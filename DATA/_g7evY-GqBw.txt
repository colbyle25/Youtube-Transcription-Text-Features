Don't go to med school. Don't let bills pile up and don't open more than three credit cards. Start a budget and keep working on it. It's not a one and done. If you have money in your account, purchase using a debit card. Don't spend more than you make. only buy what you can pay cash for. Avoid credit card debt like the plague. Money doesn't buy happiness, the nicest things in life Aren't things find the balance between saving for the future and enjoying the present. And don't kick yourself when you fail. Control credit card debt. Plan ahead. Automatically deposit a percentage of your paycheck into savings. I don't do this, but I should. My dad's advice to me was to live just at the edge of your means. have short and long term savings goals.
