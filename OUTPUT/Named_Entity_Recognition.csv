Oh, so let's be clear here all of the food that you're gonna see in this episode of cheat day is coming from the show it has appeared in the show at some point including this Chili's. And I'm assuming this is a Searcy favorite or a tyrian. There you go. It's very much a tyrian I drink and I know things. Oh, maybe we will know things after we read from the kingdom of Napa Valley. Ooh, that's a game of thrones inspired wine. Yeah. Oh, it definitely tastes like murder. I definitely taste like I'm gonna drink this and then I'm gonna kill an entire city. Yeah, there's definitely some copper tasting notes in there. There's a little bit of an aroma of blood.

--aOisk7Hf8.txt,"How low guys it's me. Hello. Welcome back to a brand new day of Halloween during Halloween for seven days straight every single day. I am uploading a Halloween themed video and today I am really really excited. So last week I was heavily bingeing on root balls drag race, all stars and one of my favorite looks out of the entire season was by Monet exchange Monet recreated that iconic look that Rihanna wore to the Met ball where she looked like a pope and Monet just added like all this red eye shadow like glitter she had like the the big red contacts on and that was probably my favorite look out of the entire season and then on Twitter Axel, Aurora tweeted me his looks and one of them is so incredibly iconic and I was like, Oh my god, this is my Halloween look right here that mouth by Axel. And then Monet's eyes and like, who it is like glam but spooky and scary but still sexy all the SS and the G for glam so if you're excited to be a bride slash demon from hell this Halloween, then keep on watching. Alright guys, let's get spoopy I do want to let you know before we get started that in this video I am teaming up with pee Louise because they recently collaborated with one of my favorite makeup artists in the moment Mitchell and They created something new called the acid rain. We're going to dip into it later I'm going to show you how it works but before we start off I do want to let you know that this video is in partnership with that so off camera I went ahead and blocked up my eyebrows using my elmers washable school glue. Now for the love of your eyebrows, please use a glue that is washable and you can take off easily. Don't be going in with like all these like hardcore stuff that you will never get out because you will get it out but your eyebrows will also get out of your skin. And for anyone who's new to makeup. What that means is you put glue on your brows a couple of layers and you're really flat and the hairs against the skin. And then once you go in with your concealer and like your color corrector This will show you no brows whatsoever. It's like you shaved them off without shaving them off. And since Monet shaves her eyebrows off. I was not going to do that today so I was going to block them out. Okay, I am noticing that I'm still waking up at seven in the morning here I just woke up like I did all this preparation Now here we go the first step we're doing today is primer This is Fenty beauty mattifying primer This is a must oh wait hold on before we do primer we have to set the glue with powder now it is primer time next It is time to color correct the brows before we go in with all that coverage because if you were just to apply foundation and concealer over this the chance that like the darkness piece through and creates like a bluish shadow is very very there some dipping into my dragon beauty skin. Wait what hold on dragon fire skin perfecting potion now I am pale as hell so I only need to tiniest bit. She got some orange bros, honey and we're done. That is my demon from hell bride from hell look. I hope you enjoyed And now it is time for the coverage finally look at my favorite part for foundation today and first going in with the stay naked by Urban Decay and mixing in a couple of drops of the Laura Mercier a flawless fusion ultra Longworth foundation Jonas, God, Dylan really loves me for my looks Hmm. You want to remind yourself that the less friction on the just glue down browse the better. So as soon as you come near the brows, make sure you use a light tapping motion so that you leave the glue in place. They went for the eye shadow later on. You don't want to be going in with a brush like it's your last day on planet earth like you want to take your time like you want to be gentle about it, approach it with love and tenderness. I look like a sick jellyfish time for concern. delivered today I'm dipping into the elf 16 hour cammo concealer. It's my first time trying this So pray for me and I am using the color light sand all right in a second I'm about to blimp this all into my skin and then I'm going to set my under eyes using the Anasazi Beverly Hills loose setting powder and vanilla and the rest of my face using this larmer CAC for breaking powder. Okay, great. Now we just went from a jellyfish to an egg. If you always wanted to be an egg during Halloween, this is what you do. Alright, off camera I'm quickly going to do my other eye to kind of see where I'm going so I know exactly how to take Tell you what to do and I'll be right back All right guys, one i is done and I am absolutely living for all of it and then just wait until that crazy content goes in and just completes the look for this I portion I told you I'm partnering up with pee Louise and in a previous video, I was using the acid rain collection p Lewis saw and they were like babe, he can't really use it as a base because apparently these set in 60 seconds so you apply them you let it rest for 60 seconds and it's set and it won't go anywhere whereas I was just using it as a base so don't be doing that. Okay, we have the base for that. They literally come in a bunch of shades like look at that like a purple. We've got like a blue This one is really really calling my attention here this Limelight This is a neon green, yellow. So they come in a bunch of colors. And these are like a drying pink. These are incredible to do cut creases to do eyeliners to do detailed work. I really like these after I got the hang of them and today I'm going to show you how they work. Oh, by the way, p Louis is now available at all Morphe stores. Congratulations page that is huge. And of course don't forget, I am also an affiliate up Louis. So if you want to save money on these, all you have to do at checkout on the website is use discount code Nikki for a discount, and guess what in the Morphe stores, you can do the exact same thing. The first product I'm going to go in with however, is not the acid rain i'm actually going in with a colored brights base also by P Louise and this is in the color rudeboy red and we're using this as a base. Alright, so I pick it up on a brush, and then I just start patting it on to the lid to get that color on. And then I'm going to work it up to the crease I mean you got rid of your brow so you've got space honey and then now going in with a fluffy brush and blending out the edges. This doesn't have to be perfect because we're going over top with a shadow Anyways, we definitely want to make sure that that edge that harsh edge is gone. All right then now going into this incredible palette by Stacy Murray and be perfect. This is the carnival extra large Pro, and I'm taking the dark like sexy color called reckless and I'm picking that up on a brush and placing it on the outer part of my eye and you want to stamp this color on top of the base, it's going to act like a magnet, it's really going to grab on to all that pigment and make it magical. And then you just want to create this smoky outer corner then going back into that same palette and taking this absolutely brightest red I've ever seen in my entire life. It's called Inferno and it is red. And I'm going to start buffing this in above that dark color we just placed and this is going to be our transition color. And think big here guys, this is Halloween. This is the time to go all out. And again, you've got rid of your brows. So take up that space. I'm also starting to place that red here on the inner corner. And again, you really want to buff and blend this in. And remember we worked so delicately on blocking those brows that once you like sort of get into the brow area with blending, just use very light pressure to not sort of like mess up the glue. Alright, it's tougher, one of my favorite parts totally blowing this up and taking it up. So I'm hopping over to the MoMA Mitchell and beauty Bay palette. And from this palette, I'm taking these two shades right here called Mr. H and milkshake and I'm mixing those two together on like, seriously such a big big brush, and I'm just gonna go ham on my eyes. And Promise me if you're recreating this look, just have fun with this one. Okay, it doesn't really matter how far you take this one up, how like extreme you want to make it. It's totally up to you. You are the boss of your own face your makeup but since it's Halloween I'm taking this bad boy up okay and then now it's finally time to dip into the acid rain colors by pure Louise like I said a paint that dries by itself so all you need to do is apply this Let it be I'm going in with the colors, blank canvas and a little bit of raver this raver is a little bit too intense for this look right here. Normally I'd be like okay, yes come through, but for today I want it to be like a soft pink. So the magic is mixing the two to create your own color. So you should kind of come up with a color like this and then I'm going to dip from there using my brush and I'm just going to carve out a new crease and then fill it in. So make sure you get it on nice and even. And now you can leave it like this and it will be absolutely brilliant but because I want to incorporate a bit more of that red tone onto the lid. I'm dipping back into that Inferno shade and just on that outer corner here where you already created that blend. I'm going to bring in a little bit of that red now This to me is some makeup porn. All right so since I'm addicted to the glamour and this is a bridal look I of course did something shimmery and glittery somewhere so I'm going in with this this is the head of beauty matte and metal melted shadows and this is in the color cherry soda and I'm using this metallic side as a base for my laner and then on top the Mitchell it's a lot of Mitchell MP Luis today, the Mitchell eyeliner topper in collaboration with beauty Bay and this one is in the color, Mama and then I'm popping the Mitchell liner on top as well. Sort of framing the very edge of the crease. Time to wrap it up for the I look so I'm going back in with that rude boy red bass and using it as the base on the lower lash line and then going in with the same two colors to buff and blend that in. Lastly a pink inner corner highlight tend to pop on some lashes and then it's time for the crazy scary mouth. Okay eyes are done and I know right now it's like a super glam no brown look like this could be Jeffrey stars every day red makeup look, but I swear once like the mouth is on and we have the creepy contacts in it. I'll post together. So now let's focus on something that I'm really scared to do because it's been a year and I've been alone. Little bit rusty is tend to do a special effects, sort of like torn demon mouth. And what I usually always do is go in with a light IRA pencil to sketch out the shapes. And then we're going to go in with all the pains and then we're going to shade and highlight and make it work and torque. Seriously no idea what this is going to turn into, but we have a shape. I mean, I don't know I'm trying Okay, time to go into a water activated red face paint. And I'm reading it right now. And I think a good first step would be to fill in everything with red except for the teeth. So that's a like an easy step to get yourself going. All right, I'm just here to remind you and mainly myself today that you should take it just one step at a time, work in layers and then fine tune in the end. So I think a logical next step is to fill in the teeth using like an off white collar. So you don't want it to be pure white, you kind of want it to be dirty like a demon. Oh my god, this is so hard. This is so so incredibly hard to do, but we have faith in the makeup gods that they pull through. Once the teeth are filled in, it's time to add in your shadows and this is the part where things start looking a little bit better, hopefully. So places you want to add shadows is like right up to the edge of the torn mouth. Like in between the teeth. Like right now it looks like a cartoon and it shouldn't Alright, shadow is attitude the corner of the mouth. I think that would be a good time to focus on the teeth and then we'll do fine detailing. Mm hmm. So using an ochre colored eye shadow, I'm just going to add shadow to the teeth. Okay, we're getting somewhere. Now it is time to add highlights in the color of soft pink to sort of like where the muscles would be in the mouth. All right time for some depth. I'm adding black in between the teeth and creating that shadow. And now let's make some magic happen by adding the highlights. Alright glow babies I promised the end is in sight. All we're going to do now is create a shadow surrounding the mouth and then highlighting in between so just a little bit under the mouth. You want to create a line of shadow and then that is going to make it a little bit more believable. Not that I think this is anywhere near believable but still All right now I'm going to line the lips Finally we have moved on to my normal lips I'm going to lie My lips using the house laboratories rip lip liner in the color sullair and filling in the rest of my lip using this Fenty beauty map was a lipstick in Griselda as the final finishing touch, I am taking the moron blood splatter and I'm going to spray some around the mouth. Oh my god. And that guy's completes this demon bride to be demon bride Brad from the demon world Halloween makeup tutorial. I think this is one hell of a scary look for Halloween to frighten someone Friends around you Alright guys, I hope you enjoyed this crazy Halloween makeup tutorial. If you end up recreating it, don't forget to tag me on Instagram or Twitter or somewhere where I can find you. And without any further ado, I hope I will see you tomorrow for a new day of Halloween.

2omuOarg2hE.txt,"Hi guys, I have been real lazy I could do a 15 minute video of me just playing Animal Crossing and you guys would stare at that that would be ideal but instead I decided to do my go to lazy food hacks that I've actually learned off the TIC Tock because let's be honest people I've been doing is eating this porn. Subscribe to this channel for for pizza to be delivered right actual door and don't forget to ring the bill and that's the only way I can bring you about Yeah, a little weird. And just a little reminder that I have a vlog channel if you're not already subscribed, we would love to have you over there right now we're doing a bunch of home vlogs and other weird stuff. So if you're into that, we'll link the channel down below. If you enjoy these types of videos go to thumbs up and if you don't give it a thumbs down that just kind of shows me how you feel about certain content. I've been snacking a lot recently. Not very proud. I'm not a big fan of Cheeto dust on my fingers. So I've been using chopsticks instead a little bit strange of a food hack but I love this technique on below. This is one that's a little too strange for you. It's made me perfect my chopsticks skills so much that I could probably put eyelashes on with it. So that's pretty cool. Here's a crazy food hack that will make your marshmallows grow four times as big or fake for any at home s'mores now get any marshmallows of your choice. Prepare your s'mores, a graham cracker at some yummy chocolate. Put the marshmallow on top, pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds and watch it magically grow. finalize with the graham cracker on top and beautiful at home.This has got to be the coolest breakfast hack I've ever seen on medium heat throwing a little bit of butter spread it on the pan Add two already mixed in eggs on top and two slices of bread. Live them to get that goodness add your toppings of choice. Then put the corners to pancake it in and flip it again buying a juicy breakfast sandwich coming right up. Tell me this is not the coolest packet. Tell me. I love it. I've been getting weird. Hey All I've been craving is cookies and no honey, I'm not pregnant. Oh hi, here's a four ingredient recipe that hits that sweet spot. So in a bowl mix one cup of brown sugar and one cup of peanut butter and one egg, one teaspoon of baking soda and half a cup of chocolate chips. I mix in some Reese's Peanut Butter chunks because my husband loves it for a little added wifey bonus mix it all up but don't use a frickin whisk it gets that split the cookie dough mix into about 12 and pop it in the oven for 350 degrees for eight to 10 minutes when they're ready to go let them cool off for 10 minutes and no they are not raw. I promise you I burned my last ones by thinking this they're just super chewy and look at that look at this yumminess I wish I could share it through the screen. If you're craving something a little more cakey this food hack is for you take some Oreos take any milk of your choice I prefer this one now pouring a little less milk I would say about four tablespoons to to cook you ratio. I know I'm getting all mathy here I did a lot more than that ratios I added more Oreos makes makes makes me Merge, then you guys pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. That's all you need for your laser boot. I realized my mug was not microwavable so I actually had to switch it up yes make sure you do that and once it's out you have the best dark and fluffy cake ever look at this oh my god get fancy at some strawberries, fudge and caramel and call it an animal crossing night. Sorry guys, I'm just the game. What can I do? Maybe I can fill my game plan for you guys. Because hunger is getting lazier and chill playing game is what I need. This next boot hack requires no skills at all. Trust me It takes some bread with the spoon pressed down to create a little dent in the bread agile egg I recommend cracking in a cup and adding it on top of your toppings of choice and put it in the oven for seven minutes at 350 degrees. Look at this the best part is you can make plenty for entire family so less of a mess and your precious time is good so that you can play more Animal Crossing Of course okay sorry guys I'm doing if you only have one tray but have two pizzas that struggle people this food hack is life changing for me. It's been cray cray cut your peaks in half and use the corners of the tray. To set them in this may require a little bit pushing, but eventually it'll fit and you'll have two pizzas for the price of one pan but we love a cheap half you guys, I've been using a strainer wrong my whole life and you probably have to check it out. If you usually do it like this, you are doing it wrong. You run into juggling two things at once and it's not draining properly, blah, blah. Instead clip your strainer like this one has a little clip I had no idea or position it like this and the water will drain better and your posture won't overflow you. If you're into dunking or Oreos, think again use a fork This is much easier than that. For two things we go crazy.

2uaGw1D-X0Y.txt,"Is that a little music? No. Is that me is now taking a little nap nap it's just like straight up burrowed right now and that is a fat mood for today. Hey guys and Happy Wednesday upload day. It is currently Labor Day right now and I am purging my closet I'm doing a massive reorganization because I feel like when I moved two and a half years ago I just brought everything and didn't really purge I've done a few like mini purges and this video isn't sponsored by poshmark or anything but I'm gonna be putting a ton of stuff on poshmark if you're interested in shopping my closet so I've got two big piles already of stuff that I've already started on or goodwill or poshmark or friends and family it's a whole thing so anyways I started doing it was like I should maybe film this because these are some of my favorite freakin videos to watch. I love organization videos like Mia's cause an organization video so That is the plan for today I just threw in a little laundry I was at the gym this morning I currently look like but that that is okay and the goal today is to get my closet back into a working order. The other problem is that Jeremy who I share a closet with has a super organized and perfect side of the closet so it makes my side look like a freakin bomb went off. I feel like when it was just me in the closet like it was fine. I was like it like it's a little cluttered. The hangers are all different colors, it's fine, but when his stuff got hung up it made my side just look like it's like if all the sections of a department store got thrown into a hurricane and then just happen to land on my side of the closet. You know some of the kids section some of the dresses some of the skirt some of the jeans that's basically what it looks like. So that's the plan for right now. Hopefully this will be a really satisfying montage and a before and after I've already purged a ton of it. Do you guys know that I just like hate wearing jeans unless they're like perfect. So I've got like 10 pairs of jeans probably going into poshmark and a whole bunch of skirt. That's the only thing that I've pretty much gone through right now I've narrowed myself down to five genes like maybe six pairs of jeans shorts. I'm just there like a few different washes and a few different fits because like you got to have like your bloated day shorts like your fit day shorts or your period day shorts. Like you got to have a few options for the size of yourself. So let me show you what we are working with me. Yes, I don't want to clean the closet. Will you please uh, help me know? Cool All right, sweet. Oh, hello. Oh, hello. Wow, that was cute. Okay, even though no couldn't cause that was very cute. I love you. Okay, let's begin. Okay, so here's what I've purged so far, a ton of jeans, a bunch of jean shorts, skirts of overalls. This is my bag for goodwill. I have to sort through that still. But here's what my hangers have already taken my closet. I've got this pile this pile and then these are all like the pants hangers. Okay, so here is the situation. Okay let me let me just show you why my side looks so bad because he's got our matching hangers and everything is kept he couldn't in delic donate it to donini and there's my side and it's just an explosion like my hangers are just from like 14 different places like you guys know I have a massive hoodie problem so that's happening I don't even know what's going on down here. This is happening just finished that so this looks great. So a myself four pairs of jeans one pair of black jeans and then this is it for shorts and skirts which basically got like habit which is great. So now I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. I think I might start with hoodies and it's like do I really need my wigs in my closet like probably not also perks having a tall boyfriend they can just like put things where you would never even like think to put things because like a girl can reach that. I think also my game plan for leggings is maybe hanging them up because this is obviously not a solution that is working for anybody also jackets. It's like girl you live in LA why you have so many jackets though, like I've definitely got some that are like photoshoot jackets like this one I just wore at the Museum of Dreamspace. And like this one is like kind of patted This one's leather. This one's got like a cute fur trim the leg Do we really need all these jackets? Probably net. I've got a whole other section over here and like okay, well this is the one that I just bought. So like we keep an hurt, I can definitely try and minimize I think some of the stuff that I have here. I just love clothes. But this is so unnecessary to have this many. So I'm gonna try and like Marie Kondo. This ish a problem is is that it all brings joy. So I don't know we're kind of stuck there. Holy crap. Okay, so it is quite literally five hours later I have never purged my closet this hard in my entire life. I don't think I'm like frustrated myself kind of because I feel like this industry is so much about excess like the amount of PR packages that we receive of free things. It's like I'm the last person that needs more free things like there's so many other places that free things could go to so I think I'm gonna do I'm gonna stop on poshmark some of the stuff to Goodwill and then some of it to a women's shelter just only get payment for profit type of situation. But yeah, holy crap. I'm also hoping to keep my closet at like a really controlled size after this purge because like, yeah, girl does not want to do this ever again. And this has been crazy. I literally had some things in my closet that I've had since I lived in Toronto five years ago, and I'm sure I brought that to college with me when I moved from my hometown. So there were definitely some things that have you know, lived their time had their life and now it's time to either go straight into the trash definitely a lot of those pieces like pajamas like why do I have so many pajama shirts? Why but holy crap you should see my room right now. Okay so stuff isn't fully organized into like where things are going but there's all this stuff here too massive urban outfitter bag all of this stuff that's folded up some trash bags still got to go through that he's have no home I have so many bags and bags for some reason all the blue hangers because look at this coordination of the pink hangers we're not officially done and also hoodie game so strong, so strong, but like look how good it looks right now this whole corner is basically empty. I don't even know what I'm going to put there like Jeremy asked for these ones so this was like totally fine. It was just like random stuff here but look a little extra space. There's like a hanger and a half. All these are pretty much open. These are just access hangers, empty shoe spots, all my coats color, coordinated black hangers and even this is an empty cubby here. I narrow down my leggings to like a crazy amount. There's can be But But I think we're gonna wrap up for today I have been watching YouTube videos listen to music going through all this it's been freakin crazy and because it's Labor Day I can't even go to Target or The Container Store or whatever to go get bins and more of the pink hangers now that I'm color coordinating like an adult we'll see how long the last floor but because it's Labor Day I can actually go and finish a can't drop off the stuff at Goodwill and get the tax done and I wanted to get some organization bins for smaller stuff like socks and underwear so this journey will continue tomorrow and in the meantime I'm gonna clear all this out of my room so that it doesn't feel super overwhelming. There's nothing worse than going to bed and waking up in a mess which is normally what I do everyday but just like not to this extent tomorrow is a day full of errands I have to get a new passport and get a passport photo taken and then maybe we'll go to Target and get some DIY supplies and some organization stuff hi guys it is the next day and I just got back from a crazy full day of errands. I got a new passport photo taken. I dropped All this stuff at Goodwill and a woman shelter, I went to Marshalls Home Goods I went to Michael's I went to Target I went to a mall. Oh my god today has been Aaron tastic. I'm also planning to go to Costco tonight. So like basically I'm just like ready to be I don't want to say mom because like, I don't want babies right now. But like, I don't know where it's going with that. Let's just say I got two babies. I was like, no baby, no baby. So I'm so stupid. I took all these like really specific measurements of the different cubbies and shelves and drawer sizes and run a measuring tape. So while at Target I had to buy another measuring tape and for someone who doesn't really measure things very often and like very much yo Lowe's everything I now have like six measuring tapes, so that's unnecessary. Anyways, I got some really cute bins and little boxes to hold thing and they're gonna fit because I measured and bought any measuring tape just to make sure honestly, the way I normally do it as I just like stick my arm up against and be like, okay, we're on my arm does this go to how many of my own arms D that's normally how I do it that's how I should have done it when I realized I didn't have a freakin measuring tape anyway let's get organizing in today's the final day and I'm ready to be officially done with this project it's taking so long oh my gosh what a freakin transformation Honestly, I need to take so many photos of what this looks like now because it'll probably never be this clean ever again. You know what actually started with a pretty decently clean shoe section hoodie game so strong rainbow gradient hoodies this makes me so happy I realized that I wear a hoodie almost every single day at least once at some point. So I figured instead of having them explode out of these shelves here it makes more sense to have it as like my everyday rack and then up there we have top there's actually Christmas sweaters and Disney sweaters submerge leggings. Oh my gosh guys, I narrow down my leggings collection by like 65 70% It's crazy. And then some other hoodies and sweaters and one Z's down there. Me have four pairs of jeans now two regulars two boyfriends, a black pair and then actually a decent amount of skirts and different types of shorts and stuff and then up here like my little itty bitty tops like the little baby ones like the crop tops and like the random stuff like that a few body suits and then all of my jackets you know what I actually am surprised at how many jackets I was like not down to get rid of like does a girl really need for pink fuzzy jackets. Yes, and then I've actually been looking for a spot forever. I feel like I'll probably end up filling up these cubbies here but for right now I don't have anything to go there which is crazy. So anyway, I just got this little jewelry display here of all my different rings and some earrings which I pretty much never wear but figure they should probably be somewhere safe and not just like stuffed in a cup and then I have some more shoes over here my like two long pieces that I own like Maxi skirts. My hats are hanging up now so they're not like getting dusty and nasty. And then I also narrow down my dress collection by so freaking much. There's like a few sets here. Regular dresses and then maxi dresses which is like basically just three or four and then all the drawers are so freakin organized and it makes me so happy what pair what bam. Oh my god. Oh my gosh okay, so we're nearing the end I think let's like do like a fun montage with the good camera maybe and we'll do like some aesthetic thing or whatever. Just have like a final look of what everything looks like because it will truly never be this clean ever again. I was planning on answering some questions I tweeted you guys asking to ask me questions that can only be answered with a yes Yes or No I totally forgot to do it as I was organizing my sock and underwear and athleisure drawers so if you're used to a speed round right now before the video and and we'll call it a day Okay, are we ready for this speed rounds all the questions on screen and just like yes or no explanation hopefully we not about to start any drama. I feel like no, I like don't even have drama. I have no t Okay, let's do this. Yes, yes. Yes. No, no. No. Yes. Yes. No, JP, no. Yes, actually. Yes, yes. No, no. No. Yes times 1000 bajillion. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Forever. Yes, infinity. Yes, yes. No, yes, I am the Burger King. Okay, so hope you enjoyed that speed round I feel like that was a little stressful I kind of just screenshot it and didn't actually like answer in my head as I looked at your guys's question, but um that's it for today's vlog. I hope you guys enjoyed my massive closet reorganization and purging all into my poshmark because that stuff will be going up on poshmark throughout the week so if you're interested in shopping any of my pieces A lot of it will be on there and also have a link to the women's shelter if you live in the LA area.

Last thing having a meet and greet on Saturday in LA at forbid anyone in Montebello those details down below as well as well as well as well.

2obhscG7GcQ.txt,"Hi everybody, thank you for watching. In today's video I am going to be showing you guys an update to my at home tanning routine. I know last year I did do a video with Ani sands and I gave you guys like the full rundown on what I was using. But about six months ago I found a new product and to me ohana Chai. To me whenever I find like a groundbreaking like new massage favorite. I always feel it's necessary to kind of redo that video. That way you guys can stay updated on what I'm using because I think one of my most asked questions is what I do for at home tanning. So I had a little bit of a busy week I had some friends visiting from New Zealand, I'm sure you guys have heard of Shan ex Oh, so her and her fiance were here and they say it was me and then we went to electric Zoo for the weekend. So it's been quite a busy week but it feels so good to be back and sitting down. Film for you guys today. So if you want to hear all about my new holy grail tanning product as well as see a demo and other tips and tricks that really, really worked for me, then please keep watching. So I'm super excited to be working with Bandai stands for the second year in a row. Their products, in my opinion are unmatched. And to be honest, this new product that I have been using for the past six months has changed my life. As I'm getting older, like I'm starting to obviously care a lot more about being in the sun and using sunscreen and just, you know, taking care of my skin because, you know, as we age, those are things we have to worry about. So this was probably one of the first summers Yeah, that I really just didn't go to the beach didn't really lay out much. I just depended on self tanning at home. And I feel like this summer was when I got the most compliments. So quick backstory. I went out to Coachella earlier in the year for the Bondi sands. They were having a new release party. So this is one of those new product came out. It's the arrow self tanning foam and I was always using the one hour Express before Then I also did try like their ultra dark which is an amazing product as well but once I tried this new product this has just been like my holy grail go to will not touch anything else. Before we get into today's video I just wanted to give you guys a couple like tricks that I was actually sharing with somebody. And they when I had told them this they were like are you kidding? I never thought to do it. So I thought it'd be really important to share that with you guys before applying a self tan at home. A lot of you guys I'm sure I've done it before. You guys know your skin type better than I do for me I have like not like super dry skin but I'm like the type where I always moisturize as soon as I get out of the shower. So if you haven't tried other self tanner is at home and you notice you get some patchy spots or anything like that. You can exfoliate at home either with an exfoliator or like an exfoliating mitt. I know a lot of my friends do use those I personally don't because I never have had that issue before. One thing that I'd really recommend when it works so well is to not shave before you self tan. So I don't know if you guys have like done self tanning at home and then until you see Like the little black dots all over your pores wherever you shave what I've found is that if I let my hair grow out a little bit, do the southtown and then when I wash it off once I shaved The next morning, my skin looks perfect and those black dots go away so I don't know what it is. She's looking at me right now. So my theory is if you shave before then self tanner like sinks into your pores or if you have like a hair follicle in the pore and kind of like blocks it from creating like those black dots. So if you don't have those problems, you're lucky but for me I noticed that it makes a big difference to shave after I self tan. So that's like everywhere on my body. I will shave after I sell tan so as I mentioned if you exfoliate I would do that in the shower before yourself tan. Dry yourself off. Do not apply any type of lotion on your body that's like key before applying self tanner what I use whenever I'm doing like weekly self tans back to back I use the self tan or razor. So this product is super easy to use. What you would do is you get out of the shower you pat yourself dry. You can apply this onto your skin like apply a decent amount all over wherever you still have some self tanner remaining. And it says to leave it on for five minutes. I always like to let it sit for about 10 minutes. And then once you've done that you can either shower it off or you can use like a wet washcloth to kind of just rub away any of the excess tans. So that's something that I would recommend if you guys are doing a weekly Tam, which is kind of what I've been doing lately. So this product is definitely really good if you guys ever have like those stubborn hard to remove areas. Another reason that this product is really nice is you don't have to go crazy on exfoliating. And you know sometimes if you go a little too heavy you're seeing it's super red and draw and that's like what you want to avoid. So now I'm going to show you guys a quick demo on how I use the product. So this right here is the new Aero foam. I love to apply it with the Bandai sans MIT. It's really really soft and silky and it makes this tangible and smoother in my personal opinion. So this product comes in one color and it's going to give you a deep bronze glow. It's very Olive tone and it just looks so great on so many skin tones I have had so many of my friends try it some a little bit paler and some a little bit darker and it just gives like this really beautiful bronze glow on everyone that I know that has tried it. So I like to apply a decent amount onto my mitt and do soft circular motions all over my body. I like to do like one arm at a time and then once I've got my whole arm I'll go in with like a little bit more and I'll do like a second coat. So when applying the tenor on your hands and also your feet, you want to just use whatever excess product is on the mat. You don't want to apply a lot like you would put anywhere else on your body because your hands in your feet will soak up the product a lot quicker. So that's just a tip so they say to leave this tan on for a minimum of six hours. What I normally like to do is I like to apply it before bed and that way I will sleep in it I can wake up showered off what's cool about this product is it's a lightweight aerosol formula which is different than their other products so you can barely feel it on your skin and it dries really quickly. So Never gonna feel like like wet your skin's not gonna feel wet afterwards and when I'm applying saw my face I also just like to use the excess product that is already on the mat I don't like to go too crazy on my face I like to just do a very very light coat because I'm usually wearing makeup anyway which will cover up the tan and it's just personal preference so to as much as you feel comfortable doing they say it lasts up to seven days but I've had it lasts even longer. And ladies I don't know if you guys like to hate the smell of self tan or your significant others hate it but this one has like a really nice coconut scent to it. It's not too powerful. So you don't feel like grossed out as you're leaving it on your skin all day who the ingredients that really helped keep this tan long lasting is vitamin E and hoepa. They both really moisturize the skin and they keep your skin super hydrated. So the end of July I was in Greece for about 12 days and I actually brought this product with me and I had done it prior to the trip that way I already had a little bit of a tan to start with. And like halfway through the trip. I did it one night before bed and I woke up so tan and everyone was like I'm so jealous you got so tan like oh wow, I didn't even tell anyone that I used the tanning product overnight. I was like yeah you know, got that Grecian tan. So for today's video I did do it during the day so I did only leave it on for the six hour timeframe because I was getting antsy and I wanted to wash it off. So normally if I leave it on overnight, it's like maybe like a little bit darker so it depends on really how dark you want to go. Try it out for six hours. See how you feel if you want it a little bit darker you can always leave it on a little bit longer. And another tip that I would have is when you do rinse your tan off the next day or after the six hours. Don't use any body wash or anything like that. Let it rinse off. If you need to use like a tiny bit of soap you can use like soap to like clean your underarms or anything like that but I would recommend not applying any soap and then once you get out of the shower, I go crazy on lotion. I'm the type of person that like not even like feel comfortable that having body lotion on So what I do whenever I do the self tan is I use the everyday gradual tanning melk. And this is also by Vonda it just helps preserve the tan a little bit longer, which is really nice, and it's super moisturizing. So that's something I would definitely recommend is like once you've showered off, you know, we use some lotion to really like lock in the color and moisturize your skin and then you're all set. And that's all you have to do. And it's so easy the whole process maybe takes like 10 maybe 15 minutes depending so you know, even some nights I get home and I know I have something to do in the next day and it's like midnight or 1am and I'm wanting to go to bed but also like take aside 10 minutes and be like You know what, I'll be so much happier if I wake up with the 10 in the morning. So that is my at home tanning routine all the products that I talked about in today's video. They're all available at Walgreens nationwide which is really cool. So you can go right into any Walgreens and pick it up. Also you can go on the website to purchase anything and it could be delivered right to your door which I'm kind of More lazy and I like to have everything delivered Personally, I'm seeing like cat hair flying all around me because child just wants to be the star of the show. Try you want to use the product. Thank you man.But I hope you guys enjoyed this video try out the product let me know what you think you will not be disappointed. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I love you all so much. And until next time, I'll see you guys later.
Love you, baby.

2NNQYT8PdhI.txt,"Okay, now pressing send now. My name is Gina. I'm 23 years old. It was June 2016. I met him through my cousin's boyfriend. He asked me out, it was really nice. He took me to sweet chick and Williamsburg. And then we went to the park nearby a little park and he played the guitar. He serenaded me, because he's a musician. But then the second date kind of made me realize that I wasn't really super interested in him partially because I just wasn't really ready to commit. I just came out a relationship. And I was really, really busy. It was about two weeks of communication before it stopped. I was kind of rude about it, though. It could have been more nicer about it because he was nice to me. So I saw him two years later on the train, and he didn't see me though. So I texted him, I was like, Hey, I just saw you on the train. And he was just like, why didn't you say hi? That I was just like, Oh, I don't know. He was just like, Well, have you been? And I didn't respond, which is awful. But yeah, but then I got ghosted and made me reflect and just feel bad for ghosting him because it was his situation where I liked someone and I don't feel like I was being pushy, but the person probably thought I was they stopped talking to me. And it's hard. And maybe you appreciate the person that I once ghosted, who was trying to basically do what I'm trying to do now. I would say I'm sorry. Not sure. I don't want the apology to turn into like, hey, do you want to try this again? Because I don't have anything like if he responds back and it's like hopeful I can lie to have a boyfriend. though. I mean, I could text him now, but I just, yeah, I could talk to them. Okay, so I'm not one to apologize via text but if I was to text, the person that I ghosted, I would probably say hey Okay, are you happy with that? Yeah. Great. hopefully catch up. But okay, yeah, good. I guess if I'm not trying to like leave him on. It should have been should be like I just want to sound Sorry if I ended things a couple of years ago I should communicate my feelings better hope all as well. I think this is a pretty good hope all as well. Yeah, I think this is pretty good. Maybe he's in a relationship. So then it'll be even easier because he won't want to talk to maybe that relationship. more pressing send now, up to you. Not delivered in green. I feel like he blocked me because I'm on Google that if it goes green in me that he blocked you. If not the text messages sent and he knows that I feel bad. I feel off my shoulders. I do feel better. Like I can feel more at peace with not the decision of ghosting but just owning up to what I did wrong. I don't regret this at all. Let me check Selena, if it goes green, and just my phone. No, it was blue. I feel bad because I'll never really be able to know if I was sorry or not. I can't hit him up in any type of way. I feel like this is a sign all I could do is just manifest in the universe happiness for him. And whatever relationship he's in and Rebecca asked my cousin how he's doing. Okay, let's try it again. It said the message failed to send but it's sent to Lena. As far as this boy blocked me

0zXfDafyyao.txt,"Hello friends and welcome to another video this week I'm going to be getting a custom black wedding dress y'all can stop tweeting me now it's happening now as some of you might know, I am engaged the trolls off y'all affianced, and a few months ago we went shopping for my wedding dress and we ended up picking out a really amazing gown with some pretty epic medieval sleeves. Look at that sleeve tie with a couple of details still left up in the air like the fabric and the final fit, but we said sure, to the frock. I really love it. I really, really, really like it. And that dress is still going to be my wedding dress. But for a while I've been teasing the idea of doing a white swan Black Swan moment and having a second dress that I can change into for the party portion of the evening. So that is what we're going to be working on now. The Oh deal dress If you will, or the Mila Kunis one unless you think she's just a figment of Natalie Portland's imagination, that movie came out in 2010. I don't know why I'm still talking about it. Now the first questions some of you may be asking is why do you want a black wedding dress at all? Well, I wear a lot of black. It started off as like a theater kid is stagehand thing. Yes, I was a theater kid, no one is surprised and that predilection has now taken over my life and closet entirely. So a black wedding dress is definitely in my wheelhouse. In fact, some of you were surprised when I chose a white dress at all. Now my line of thinking this whole time has been like if there's one occasion in my life to wear a white gown, this is it. And I really love the Juliet dress that we chose, as well as the fabric we ended up picking out for it. However unintentionally, the fabric we settled on is gonna end up being pretty heavy and a bit fragile. And for some insider info Tyler and I are Planning a somewhat intricate choreographed first dance. So I pretty much definitely need some kind of second dress to Boogie in. So I thought why not a black one? The second question you guys may have is why custom Now there are a lot of black gowns like out there in the world. But when it comes to choosing a second wedding dress, I kind of want something that would both compliment the first dress stylistically, but also not upstage it or downstage it too much. So kind of a tall order. But thankfully through our shopping process for our first dress, we were able to meet the designer of it, Stephanie white of odle in the ceremony, and when she heard I was looking for a black wedding dress to compliment our Juliet gown. She was intrigued, and she thought it could be really fun to work on something custom together. So I said yes to working on a custom dress, and thus began our journey. So to start off, we hopped on an initial FaceTime call with Stephanie to kind of gameplay All right. Hi, Stephanie. How are you? Good. How are you doing, dude? Okay, we pulled an all nighter last night. So we're like a little crazed right now. Okay, so leading up to this call, I had started pinning stuff to a shared Pinterest board as well as sharing Stephanie on our general wedding one just so she could get a feel for the vibe we were going for. Now our general wedding theme has kind of evolved a little bit initially I was describing it as A Midsummer Night's Dream in autumn with kind of like Christmas lights and exposed brick but it's sort of grown into more of a starry night concept as we've added a lot of decor with Moravian stars moons and twinkly accents. I've like pinned a bunch of like celestial patterned fabrics. I don't know if there's like that possibility out there. So most of the dresses I was gravitating towards were more on the whimsical side with like beading or shear layers, you know, just things that had some ethereal ness to them. Yeah, I think you should definitely fit with the wedding gown. So it's not like whoa, where did this come from, you know, from another planet or something, but I think we'll keep it in the same vein, I know that you like the long sleeves. And I know that you like the flare, but we can maybe like minimize it a little bit. There's also a fair amount of these sleeves that are like almost like the opposite of a bell where they're almost like they're poofy. And then they cinch at the wrist early. So those are super cool also. So I'm open to like any kind of interesting sleeve. Really, I love sleeves, like sleeves are just the theme. So with some of my ideas out of my head and onto Pinterest, the next question was how we were going to turn those pins into a dress. What is our plan of attack? The plan is I'm going to go to Pinterest for it and to sort of see what makes sense and then I think that we can start to sketch so our next meeting would be in person to see some of these sketched out silhouette options that Stephanie had cooked up from our conversation and then choose one of them. That sounds perfect. So I will see you next week. Yes. All right. See you soon. Bye. Now joining us for our sketch reviewing session was Christie Baird, who some of you may remember as the owner of low hoe bride who helped us pick out our first dress and was also the one who linked us up with Stephanie in the first place and we were all going to be taking a gander at three different silhouette options. So here is look one which we talked about sleeves because we know your sleeve girl Yeah, I am. I'm a sleeve lady. Look. One is a generally fitted silhouette that hugs the abdomen and then starts to flare out below the hip with sheer poofy sleeves and a plunging deep V at the cleave point to plunging something like classy. Chocolate Shroff or Chester Yes. Look to somewhat similar to look one in that the sleeves are also shear and voluminous and cinched at the bottom I feel like both of them have this like cool like gathered nest which I really like as almost like a foil to like the open like Bell sleeve of the first look but instead of being fitted look to has some shearing at the waist to provide more of an A line skirt. It also has a deep v but it's covered by a high neck shear overlay. It's sort of similar to these looks that Stephanie's designed look three is very different from the other two. Wow, this one is giving you that whole princess fairytale vibe. Yeah, but then this design is off the shoulder with a notch neckline and an A line skirt. And there's that sleeve detail which is exactly the same length as the skirt and it opens out where your hands can peek out playing off of these dresses that I had pinned and also this one that I tried on way back when at low whoa and liked but didn't end up picking it would definitely give some drama like they definitely fly around a little bit for sure. And honestly after seeing them I thought that all three of these sketches were really awesome and did hit a lot of the things that I had initially been interested in. But I had to make a choice and right off the bat I had a couple of concerns with option number three specifically that it would not really solve our problem of needing a more practical dress for dancing purposes with both the off the shoulder being restrictive to my upper arm mobility a lot of my girls that do off the shoulder do it for ceremony because they want the photos and and then they sweat out of the off the shoulder. Yeah, the reception Not a lot of people going the other way, not as as well as the cape sleeve situation that I so loved potentially getting in the way like you might be like twirling through your own sleeve. That might happen regardless. But like, I feel like let's not make it harder for me. So we decided to next dress number three, which left us with options one and two. Now the differences between these sketches mainly come down to the neckline of which dress to use is quite high. I'm nervous about like this guy getting covered, right? Yeah, I don't know, not not getting covered, but I'm worried about like, we kind of know something well, I'm dancing to Yeah, Flipside Are you going to be warm with something up this high, and besides any potential double chinning the sheer overlay would also obscure the deep V, which I actually thought could be a good idea to highlight because it would mirror the neckline of my other dress. So we'd have that kind of continuity going. I don't mind the DP. I'll just get my chest waxed. Now between the two skirt silhouettes. I usually favor more flowy ones but I was actually surprisingly drawn to the more snug style. I think having a nice like booty moments, especially if you're dancing. No. I'm down for that. I could be open to a booty moment. audience could absolutely you see the booty hump and then you see the little squiggle. So between these two, which one feels like the front runner, so all things considered, I would say that style number one has that practicality for dancing with some dramatic flair without things flying around. So it seemed like the perfect choice. Weirdly, I can't say I like knew that this dress existed, but I feel like this was kind of in my head. So we decided to go with that one. Amazing. Okay, this is good. I'm excited. And the next step after choosing our silhouette was to have Stephanie's pattern maker whip up a Muslim version of our dress for me to actually try on. Alright, so we are here back again at low hope bride and today we're going to be meeting up with Stephanie and her pattern maker Rita to take a little sneak peek at the Muslim of the black reception dress. Now a Muslim is essentially like a prototype version of a dress that you can use to finalize the pattern before you make it in the final fabric. Can't wait to get into it. So I popped into the dressing room to see how it was looking. Very dramatic ready? I think it's great. Oh, yeah. Good. Yeah. It really exactly where you are. For just a rough draft. I honestly thought the dress looked pretty spooktacular The color is perfect. Obviously the shade, the shade. Yes, it's not a color. I've been told. And I think a lot of the details that we had focused on in the sketch are looking good IRL. I like this shape. And I love the shear sleeves and the V Yes, I like a lot of it. Yeah, I'm so happy about that. But yeah, I like a lot of things to Stephanie and Rita had some standard Fit Alterations they wanted to make you feel rock'n'roll. Definitely, yeah, a little so they picked me up in a variety of locations. This is your Apex point. This is my Apex apex, the peak of the mountain For my part, I only felt like we needed to make small tinkerers to the silhouette like making the waistband more narrow and maybe exaggerating the sleeves slightly I feel like if we could try and get like a little more height in the shoulder and like a little more sharing, like near the wristband, that would be perfect, especially on the topic a little right. Dramatic blow everyone's had more drama. So I told them to really go for it in terms of sleeve poof Enos Yeah, and I think when we fit it again and we need to reduce it easier. See it? Yeah, totally. And then reduce Yeah, go big and then go home. The other thing that we needed to adjust was the length of the skirt. I wanted to make sure that we couldn't see too much of my shoes from underneath the dress so I'm wearing like straight up like a jazz shoes like for like dancing purposes. But at the moment, there was a beautiful full full on train behind me and unfortunately, I think it had to go for the sake Our Tango I mean, you want to go like floor length all the way around. Yeah, I don't think we can have any train otherwise I think I'm gonna trip on it. Okay, yeah or he's gonna trip on it. So you're someone's gonna trip on it. But besides those tweaks we were fired up for our frock awesome. Yes. Oh good. I feel good. I feel like you feel good. I like it. Yeah, faces like lighting up. I don't just like it. I love it. And with our final silhouette within reach, it was time to pick our fabric spirit fingers. Now, originally it Stephanie had thought that something like a black velvet could be good for our gown and she had actually found a couple of swatches of different velvets that she showed us on our sketch reviewing day. I keep petting this one. I feel like these skills are gonna get petted. I know I'll just keep petting myself how to spend my wedding touching myself with however, we had already chosen a velvet tuxedo jacket for Tyler's wedding outfit. And that's I was kind of nervous about clashing so we took her swatches to Tyler's tux place to compare and none of them really matched. Maybe we shouldn't do velvet for you. Yeah, I feel like unless it matches perfectly it's not going to make sense. Yeah, y'all should be moving a lot in that second dress. Yeah. But you're gonna sweat everywhere. I'm already sweating right now. Can you see it on my head? No, I can. Endless and with velvet more or less mixed. Stephanie suggested that we all go fabric shopping together so we could see a lot of different black fabric options in one go and then make our choice. So we met up one afternoon with two fabric stores on our itinerary rag finders and mood. All right, so we are here at rag finders in downtown LA ready to search for some fabric for our dress. Basically, rag finders is like a deadstock fabric Emporium, which means that all of these fabrics are like no longer in production. They've ended up here and they will not be making any more of them. I swear. I have dress from Urban Outfitters from this fabric. This could be that fabric. So if you find something that you like, grab it and run well pay first but yes, rabbit pay and then run. So I'm going to be meeting Stephanie here as well as Sarah who works at rag finders who's going to be helping us explore adventure quest. They've disappeared. Make all right, navigate. Navigate is a good word. Listen, she's gonna be helping us navigate this place. I can hear them on the on the mic. She said Did we lose them? A little bit a little bit because it's large and labyrinthine. It could be pins. I don't know. You could see me holding my eyeballs in my hands. I don't know. In all seriousness though, what rag finder is is super cool and there are a lot of hidden gems there. Look at this blue camo print. It could make you a pair of joggers out of that you look like one of the Cheetah Girls and we decided to start our expedition in the lace room upstairs through a crevice in terms of laces we were looking for something with a semi Gothic vibe without looking to table Coffee or to floral. You got to do this with all the fabrics so I can kind of see them. You can just cocoon me inside of them. So cobwebs were in. I like it because it's kind of spiderweb II and it's pretty geometric which I also like a lot. It's kind of wicked. I like that. But fruits were out. I don't love the pineapple type situation. Yeah, you're right. And it does look like a pineapple. pineapples just make me think of Fibonacci numbers, which makes me think of sixth grade math. And Stephanie also wanted a fabric with some heft to it. No, I don't like Yeah, no, I don't think so. It's not thick enough for me. It's not giving me the beefy vibe. We need. We need a beefy fabric here. needed beefy back. Where's the beef? And after pulling a fair amount of fabric rolls out of the depths, I don't know how to get in there. There we go. I'm super useful. Like delivering a baby and then having to put them back where we found them. I'm like jousting, put them up tie. I'm jousting with you. Yeah, we gathered a few possible lease options and then decided Head over to another part of the store. Alright, let's wait a second and squeeze it so good a metaphor for putting on space but on our way over there Sarah did spot one last lace one last gallop at your knees. Oh now our first dress Fabric is a beaded scallop pattern with ever so slight Art Deco vibes, so I had kind of been keeping half an eye out for scallop patterns in the lace room. Wait, this one's actually awesome. This one's kind of really awesome. This is really awesome. So Sarah had done good good find you know how to look at things. There is the bane of fabric store. I was born and the fabric store. Unfortunately though, once we pulled it out we realized it was too narrow of a bolt to actually cover my body. So it was a no go but maybe we can like take a little for inspo or something. Yeah, still on the hunt. We headed downstairs past more mountains of fabric. Good I have a shirt made out of this. So that was like Tyler to the Jakarta area to try and see if we could find anything sparkly or patterned with kind of a celestial vibe or Thai look. It's hollow. We did end up finding one shimmery metallic fabric. That could have been an option but none of us were really feeling it. I think it's not right. Okay, there we go. I don't think so. That's why we do it. And without finding a clear front runner. We could also go with the firetruck. Here, you know, it'd be interesting. I mean, it would be red hot. Stephanie exited. They're just like, Oh, we decided to say our free to saying to rag finders and head over to our second destination mood of Project Runway fame. I'm trying to remember all the things that Tim Gunn says I don't know if he just says let's go to mood. Yeah, right. Alright, time to go to mood. Thank you mood. Yes. Now beyond that mood is more of a standard fabric store with Just a wide range of options. This one's kind of funny, not for the dress, but just in life. And so we inevitably found a lot of things that were not going to work like Shaggy, delicious shag delicious. With interesting patterns, is it like vaguely animal print esque? the subtlest difference, as well as textures. Oh, there's feathers over here. But there's a lot of feathers over here. But something that mood did have a fair amount of was good sparkly options. Oh, wow, that's really nice. Actually. Now I was down for some sparkle. But we did have to be careful with beading because we didn't want anything that could snag in a dancing situation. Especially during this move. The buns are rolling where Tyler spins me around on the ground. I think would you do your butt's rolling? I think it'd be busted everywhere. And though we did end up finding a couple of good options. It's kind of cool. Yeah, I don't foresee these falling off. Stephanie had to secretly found a treasure in the corner that she was eager to show me Yeah. Ready, get ready, get ready. I don't know if this is right, but like, I got a little excited just Oh yeah. Which was a sheer black fabric with embroidered stars. Oh, wow. It's pretty awesome. It's pretty awesome, right? That is pretty nice. And though I had kind of given up hope of finding a celestial patterned fabric like this, it was one of the things that was all over my initial Pinterest board. And they're not like stars where they're like, oh, they're stars are a little abstract. He stars you know, it was very different from all of the other options that we had considered. This is really good, but it was light seemed easy to dance in and would match so many other elements of our wedding that it really felt like a winner. I mean, kind of like out of all the stuff that we've chosen. This is definitely you. Yeah, I think so too. I think this could be the one honestly I think that's also like the first time I've like felt that way and haven't checked out. So many different fabrics from velvets to pineapples to fire trucks, it felt kind of surreal to finally find something we liked so much. All right, you had a pretty awesome. Listen to the stars. Is that same kind of thing? No. I don't think so we decided to go with this one. I guess that was a resounding Thank you mood. Thank you. And with our material and our silhouette chosen, it was time to put the whole thing together and do a fitting in our final fabric ready? Yes. Okay. Thank you all. radically black wedding dress. Let's do it. Well, that was dramatic. This God and right away. We were pretty pumped with how it was looking. I love it. I love it. It looks amazing. I'm excited about it and with how it was twirling Wait, are you ready for this? I didn't realize I can do this now. Well, I didn't know you could do that. Either one did one more time. Yeah. You weren't ready for that. No, I was ready, but I want to see it again. Okay, I was ready. You know, there are a couple of things in this more final version that are kind of new to the design. Oh, wow. first of which is the sleeves which originally were going to be made out of a plain black organza but after Stephanie went home with our story fabric and kind of hung out with it for a second, she suggested that we instead do the sleeve in our fabric just online. I think it was a great decision to do the sleeves in the same fabric as yes agrees and you can see them all on my arm. We also slightly changed the opacity of the bodice to feature our stars more prominently, which actually nicely matches the sheerness of the first dress as well. And what's really pretty too is the back. Oh, look at this little cluster over here. You got a milky way right there. So besides those changes, I was also quite pleased with the added volume in the shoulder area who gets poof, also we went. Yeah, as well as the snugness. On my behind there is a little bit of a booty moment. Yeah, sorry, just like I pan right here, but pan, zoom, zoom to your booty. Um, but it wasn't so snug that we couldn't still Boogie a little. The thing is, is that it's like really light and comfortable. So I can totally see myself dancing around. Yes, definitely. Let's get your butts rolling, right. All the buttons are rolling. But it's okay. What's rolling? sounds better. All of the details aside, though. I think this dress was without question. Just 100% of the right dress. I feel like this is so you and you know, and basically, we nailed it. And I think we were all really happy with it completely. It's an extension of the main gown and I just think it's stunning. Yeah, me too. Now, as you guys could probably tell over the course of this Vidyo this dress making process took quite a while and frankly between this dress and our first dress, we've been working with Stephanie and Christie and all of their partners basically all year. It's been such a great experience to get to know them and work with them and I'm so grateful that they were willing to let me be so involved in the design process from the initial sketches to the dungeons of rag finders, you guys are full Gollum right now literally finding the Ring of Power in the darkness. I'm super excited for both of the dresses that we've made together and I can't wait to show them to you guys in the next episode. So let's get our butts rolling and get married. Thank you so much for watching and once again a huge thank you to Stephanie for making this beautiful dress. I am so excited to see how it performs with me while we dance.

_vBpo55RwLY.txt,"You know, it's interesting how you can feel like you're doing well in life and making progress and taking care of yourself Mind Body soul, really focusing on the skincare routine, you know, losing weight feeling a little bit thinner. And then you get in front of all the lights and the Ultra HD camera Who's shooting in 4k and you just look at yourself and think Oh, nevermind. So welcome back to my channel you guys light is so crazy right now for everybody that I have been kind of struggling with like what to film and what to do. I've been spending a lot of time on Instagram stories just like doing like random daily stuff just like showing you guys random things around my house because I'm just kinda like, you know, making things work while being quarantine. You know, I'm doing a lot of coloring. I'm doing so much reorganizing and just rearranging in my house and redecorating if you will, with the things that I have focusing a lot on myself. I haven't really been doing much makeup but when I do makeup, I'm doing a very, very very minimal amount and it's so interesting because when you get used to seeing yourself with absolutely no makeup whatsoever and those around you get used to seeing you with no makeup whatsoever when you put on a small amount it's like oh my god like the other day I was wearing this exact makeup look that I'm going to do here today on camera. I couldn't believe how much my boyfriend was complimenting me he's just like you're so beautiful your skin is so glowy Your eyes are so gorgeous and I'm like geez just because I put on some makeup just a little bit of makeup like the compliments are just overflowing so I figured that this is just like the perfect time to film something easy, breezy. It makes you feel good. You know we're in quarantine right now at least I'm in quarantine right now in the state of Florida. I don't know when that's going to be up. So let's just start doing our makeup. Let's just do something easy. I definitely like want to push you guys if you love makeup, don't let yourself fall into like a depression during this time. throw on some mascara, throw on some gloss do like a little concealer makes you feel fresh, you know and then you start getting into the routine of doing your makeup and then it just it makes you feel better makes want to do other things in your house throughout the day too. And you don't just lay there Feel like a piece of garbage which can so easily happen to so many of us So, Alright, let me jump into my makeup. I look at my brushes. I literally said there you go grab a few brushes for my easy makeup routine. And then here we are just a few brushes that are needed. Okay, I'm going to pin my hair back to get all this out of my face. I tried the new it's not new at this point. It came out a while ago but it's the Dyson hairdryer that has like the attachable heads on it and you can like give yourself a blot on all that jazz. I tried it honestly guys, I don't see any difference whatsoever. My hair looks just as crappy as always and it gave me a lot of frizz a lot and I'm normally not a frizzy person. Look at that tan on my wrist. Y'all know who I feel like right now. My hair. Like this, what's his name? Orlando Bloom and Lord of the Rings. That's how I feel right now. So first things first that I always do for this easy makeup look and I do for every Look, it doesn't matter what I'm doing is i prime my face. I personally over the years have become a very big believer in primer. And I definitely have recommendations for primers that I personally love. I think the primer is very much like skincare in the sense that it is truly a person to person basis what's gonna work for me might not work for you. It depends if you're oily, if you're dry, if you're combination, like what your issues are and what you're trying to achieve. Like if you're someone who your makeup does not stay on all day and you have really bad issues with it. Just kind of like breaking up and separating. You're gonna want something stickier if you're oilier you're gonna want something more mattify it's there's two different types of primer I personally, I've been using this one now for years as the sissy one it is so ridiculously expensive. I don't understand how that you can get away with charging as much as I do because people like me, the dumb asses of the world, they go out and they continue to repurchase it and that's why they get away with murder, but it's worth it because it's my favorite primer of all time. If you cannot afford primer or if you don't want to use primer or you don't own primer, just use a moisturizer like wash your face like cleanse, moisturize and then get to your makeup within like 20 minutes and that just having like that moisture that fresh moisture on the skin will help to make up more than just like dry skin that has been completely untouched for hours after priming. The first thing I do is I go in with concealer because this is not going to be like a full face routine. I am going to cover the whole face but in a very different way than I normally do. And when it comes to concealer, I have three concealers I have been loving right now and they're all different price points. So the one that I've been using is the Pat McGrath concealer. This is a new formula that she just came out with and it is so beautiful, but it's Pat McGrath her packaging her formulas, they're always very expensive. They're very luxurious. So this is going to be a price your concealer. Your next step down is going to be tart shaped tape that's going to be a little less expensive. And then underneath that the least expensive is going to be the Morphe concealer so it's going to be high middle and lo I honestly love all three of them so much but if I'm being totally real, you guys are going to be What the hell Jacqueline cuz I've been so dedicated to tart shaped tape. I actually can officially say that I like the Morphe one more I know I know people are gonna be like oh my god it's because you're so close with Morphe maybe I am but I love the Morphe one I actually like the wand of the Morphe one so much more. I think that's the thing that like really makes me love it but those are concealers three from price points and they're all so amazing. The Pat McGrath one does oxidize mean is going to get a little bit darker on your skin after having on for about 30 minutes so if you are looking for a concealer definitely go a little bit lighter rather than darker because it's going to deepen on your on your skin tone. So what we'll do we'll do I'm going to go in with Pat McGrath in the shade l m 11. Because I do have a spray tan on my body it's wearing off on my face as you can see I'm like getting old pinky and Rosie but I do have a spray body as you can clearly tell this is just this is rough ladies and gentlemen and I'm going to go and with this hourglass brush right here. They sent this to me in PR a few weeks ago and I've just really been liking it and I will use my beauty sponge as well. But this one Just kind of been my routine recently. I just kind of dab this all over the cheek area first. And then I'll go in and blend out with my beauty sponge This is not necessary, you do not have to use this brush first, you can go straight in with your beauty sponge or however you want to apply it. Honestly dropping this and going with your fingers is another great alternative. I actually have done this quite a few times the past I would say two months because I have forgotten how well your fingers work on the skin. You know, they say that these are the natural makeup brushes that God gave us. And when you use your fingers, it just makes the product melt down into the skin so beautifully. So if you don't have brushes that you like, or if you can't afford brushes, or whatever it may be, use your fingers to do your concealer and foundation. I did it for years and I loved it. So don't forget the power of your fingertips like no lie. That looks freaking amazing on my under eye right now and I just use my fingers to do that. So there you go. I'm going to take that same shade and Just drag it down here. Yes, what I am doing right now seems a little crazy because it's like why not just use a foundation, don't ask. This is just my way of doing things I love using concealer on my face, but a small amount it's just I don't know there's something different about the formula of concealer is all over the skin and it is a small amount of it that I love. If I go on Foundation, I immediately get too heavy handed like immediately I can't control myself and I put so much on but when I use concealer, I use a very light amount and it's mostly counting on a BB cream because with this look, I still want to be able to see my skin I don't want it to look like I have a full mask on like I do when I'm doing a full face of makeup with lashes and a smoky eye and that whole vibe. I definitely want it to be like okay, yeah, she's wearing makeup but like she looks fresh more than anything. So if you have freckles for instance, in this makeup look, you're going to still want to be able to see a little bit of your freckles. They're just gonna look faded. The only reason we're putting on concealer is just to even out the skintone not necessarily to cover things up. If you want to cover up a blemish, you know like I have one Right here, I'll cover it up a little bit with this. You can go on with a thicker thick year a thicker creamier concealer like a Bobby Brown like pot concealer, that's like much thicker can see there's a common Potter always thicker than concealers that come in tubes, they're always thinner. So if you want to cover up a spot of any sort whether it's a dark spot if it's a mole if it's a freckle if it's a blemish of any sort, get like a thick concealer, and then you can put on before your concealer, let it sit for like 60 seconds, kind of dab on the edges and then go in with a liquid concealer like this on top of it and that's gonna be the best way to cover up any blemish but other than covering up blemishes. We want to see the skin in this makeup look. I always always always put just a little bit of concealer on my eyelids. I'm not actually swiping on my leg. I'm just taking what's left over on my beauty sponge and just lightly going over my lid especially for me because I am such a naturally fair toned woman I have so many veins on my eyelids and if I don't cover that up, it's like oh bitch, like why is the rest of your face perfect and I can see all these blue veins popping through your eyelids. So I always just do Really, really, really send them out. popped on there to cover that up. I'm going to grab one shade lighter and I'm just going to put a tiny bit right here just to blend that out on my under eye just for a little dimension. Nothing crazy but I always like my under it to be a little bit lighter in tone. Something else I wanted to mention if you are a makeup artists This is an incredible Carvel palette it comes in three different tones. It comes in a warm, a cooler and a neutral. If you're not a makeup artist and you sweat this in general it's so amazing. I used to use this back in the day guy I used to have this in my freelance Kit 10 years ago. Just so wild you guys I am turning 30 this year what the hell this is the graph Toby and cosmetics foundation and concealer right here. This is the warm kit. I have several of them like I said it comes in three for working makeup artists. This is such a beautiful foundation to use as foundation and concealer and this is something that I also do. If I don't want to use concealers I will just take a brush and dab it in my colors and literally just like spot corrector on my face and move on. Just doing that tiniest step curling your lashes, putting in some clear brow gel It's not going to be like oh holy Wow You look amazing but it's just going to freshen up the face a little bit just putting on a little concealer and I'm not talking about what I have on right now I'm talking about just like little spot characters a little bit under your eye. A little bit of redness around your nose just some touch ups but the graph Tolkien palettes are incredible and I've recently fallen in love with them. Okay, so now for bronzer I'm gonna go on with a cream bronzer. I have two that I love and Sally they are both luxurious brands and they are very expensive. The first one is your right here this is the air flash foundation. And this is ridiculously beautiful it looks like skin when it goes on it just like melts into the face. And then right here buy Chanel again another luxurious brand This is the soul a Tandy Chanel. Yes I finally have that right after like eight years of trying to pronounce that. Another cream bronzer. I love this one so much. This one is super super, super easy to apply more so than the Dior air flash because this is a spray and if you're a beginner, you might kind of struggle with it. Now there are tons and tons and tons of different cream contours out there cream, bronzers whatever it is you're looking for. Sorry, my Nose itching. I have the worst allergies right now. And it looks like I'm picking my nose all the time but it is what it is. But these two are just my personal favorites never gonna lie to you guys and mislead you guys I do love the Smashbox contour six right here I have this one shade. It comes in two shades and then a highlighter shade. I really love these. I've used them for years. But for today's Look, I want something that's a little bit thicker and actually a little pencil it's too tedious and time consuming. I want something I can lose go into bronze bronze, bronze, bronze, bronze and then move on with life. I honestly haven't been able to find one. That's amazing. That is a really inexpensive price point. Which is just how it sometimes works you guys like I've noticed now I'm really diving in so deep into checking out so many different factories and working on product development for my own brand and like really getting to know product and ingredients. I've realized why so many of these brands charge so much like as a consumer I'm like, you're just greedy. Why are you charging so much for this? Like why can't you lower the prices come on. Now I'm realizing like, Oh, I wanted to do this palette that was like, such a genius idea in my mind that I was like people are gonna freaking love this but for this palette Not even having incredible packaging, just the product inside the pallet was going to cost $65 retail in order for me to make any profit, and like $65 for a pallet, they're like, yeah, it's because you came here and you requested these ingredients and requested such a high, like luxurious product with such incredible ingredients. And I'm like, Oh, I'm starting to understand more. There are some brands who literally just slap their logo on it, and they're like, we're gonna overcharge. But there's other brands who are genuinely putting out incredible products and they have to charge that price because of that. So it's just so interesting. You know, it's so interesting getting to see like the behind the scenes of really how this industry works and the prices and everything. It's just, it's crazy. But anyways, I don't know I've gone off on a tangent, but I'm just gonna pick up this little buffer brush right here. This is the morphine m 449. I'm going to use this to put on my bronzer. I'm going to use the Chanel watch because it is so dang easy. So I'm going to roll that brush around and I always have a paper towel when I'm doing my makeup. And I just dab off a little bit of the excess so that it's not too aggressive. I was going to take that and start to apply it from the tops of my cheekbones. I've always said it, you want to start up by the top of your ear and start to bring it down towards the corner of your mouth, your mouth and same thing every time I go in, I get a little bit more and I tap off a pinch of the excess. So that's not too aggressive when I go in on the cheeks. We're gonna bring that down a little bit because we're not contouring today like we're not trying to get a snatch look, we're just trying to walk the face and look nice and fresh and supple and dewy, youthful glowy all the above up around the hairline. As always, I never forget the step. If you have a really small forehead, you don't have to do this, like a tiny little forehead like Kylie Jenner's forehead. You don't have to put bronzer up there. But if you've got a normal sized forehead to a bigger forehead, always always slap some bronzer on that bitch makes the face just overall looks so much more put together and will also give the appearance of a smaller forehead and Anytime I go on with cream anything I always go over with my beauty sponge just to make sure that if there's any brush marks whatsoever This is just gonna make sure that that all melts away and gets pressed back into the skin. So now let's go on to blush so now we have nothing but creams on our faces right and same faces as if you're all doing this with me the exact same time but there's nothing but cream on my face right now we've got the concealer and the bronzer and that's it we don't have any powder. So therefore, if we're going to go on with powder, any seasons we're setting powder otherwise we're gonna get blotchy we can't just go in with a powder blush right now. Otherwise it is going to kind of like across the face unless you have a super matte concealer on or a super matte foundation cream blush I'm going to go in with this color pop blush stick. I think this is semi new. It's called blush sticks with an X. They sent this to me I got it just a couple of weeks ago. This is the shade under pressure. It's like a really pretty Coralie shade. So instead of going in and just putting it directly on my cheeks, because if you do that can almost act like an eraser. I just kinda like removed the product already on there. So I'm going to do about Grab a brush, this is the J h oh eight. So I'm going to take it directly off there. I'm going to get quite a good amount of product all over this brush like so damn a pinch off matrix out too strong. And I'm going to go in all over the apples of the cheeks just stamping it with a cream brought blush, I actually like to go closer to the nose than I typically would, especially when we're doing like a fresh look that I'm doing today. And we're not going to be focusing on the eyes much at all. I love that blush look even if you sweep it across the nose, which I'm going to do a pinch on the nose as well before I'm done with this, but I like to put it literally on the direct apples and kind of bring it up here and just kind of melt it into the bronzer and take it back a little bit and I'm going to take that and just go like right here on the tip of my nose and then we're going to go in it looks crazy right now but that is why we always go back with a bunch. This is like the saving grace to All makeup honestly doesn't matter you're working with cream or powder going in with this just puts everything in place and makes it look so blended out and smooth over the nose. I don't know if you can see the difference on camera between this cheek and this cheek This one has only been used by the brush. This one has been used by the damn beauty sponge and this one is definitely choppy and not looking fresh or good where this one is much more blended, looking airy and fresh. So we're just gonna do the exact same thing and there's really no power to it you just dab dab dab all over. Okay, so now that I have on my cream blush, my cream bronzer and all the creams I'm going to go in I'm going to set my under eye and my under eye only because I want my face to stay super dewy and I do not want it to get mad that's the point of this and also once we start setting then it's like we got to go with more products. Okay, now we have to rebuild the blush rebuild this and it's like we don't want to do that. I want to keep this as is just looking fresh and healthy and skin like so. I'm going to go in with two products at my under eye because I'm just high maintenance when it comes To my under eye and everything else in life. So this is the Kat Von D palette right here I'm going to go in with the middle shade which is a yellow base. I'm going to mix it with the bare minerals well rested This is a powder made for the under eye makes you very fresh and very rested. It's going to take my brush and put a little bit of both on to it. I take it in no corner and then I just bring it down inside the nose and back up right there on the very top of the cheekbone because I don't want to set all of this. I only want to set the under eye with a very light amount if you get heavy handed, it's going to defeat the purpose once again because it's gonna look just like powder on your under eye and it's gonna start to look creepy and dry because the rest of your skin is not going to have powder on it. So make sure you're very light handed it will also take that and set my eyelids with that as well just so that it looks all even around this area. And because I did put a little bit of concealer on my eyelids I do not want that to crease either. So now we have the eye area set It is looking bright and white, which is totally fine and everything comes together in the end. That's how it always works right? Okay, so I'm going to go on with one of my products right here. This is a Jacqueline cosmetics loose highlight. This is actually one of the mood lights because it came out with three different types of highlights for holiday. And this is in the shade feeling it so it is a much darker shade than my complexion much, much darker. But that's the point is I'm going to take this and I'm going to put it all around the cheeks. Now if this was not the mood light formula, I would not be doing this I would not do this with a bronzer of any sort. Unless it was super, super, super fine the way the mood light is and it has that beautiful shimmer in it so it's not going to get patchy because as we know, a matte product can get patchy so much easier than something with shimmer. And the more shimmery it is, the easier it's not going to get patchy. So that's why I'm using this specific shade right here. So I'm going to dip my brush into it like that type of a little bit of excess and then I'm going to go in on The cheek area and just softly apply that and I just do a little bit at a time because I do not want to see like this big drastic difference. I'm just using this to kind of set that area and like a really beautiful glow along with some bronze do it. This is actually something that I just started recently doing. I was not doing this up until just like maybe a month ago. And now every single time I do my makeup, I do this because I just think that it's so pretty. And it's very sheer and effortless. It's not like BAM has major huge like impact. It just looks so pretty for every day. For my eyelids. I'm going to the easiest thing in the entire world. I'm literally going to take two shades right here. This is from my original Jaclyn Hill palette right here with Morphe it's going to grab two shades and literally just dust it in my crease when she light promotions back and forth. I'm looking at myself doing this in a mirror that's like four feet away from me right now I can barely see what I'm doing but it doesn't matter. I'm just going to put this all over. This is like literally how models do their makeup and I don't understand how they do This like all the time, it just looks so perfect because for me, I'm like, this is the quick, effortless like running out the door, 10 minute, maybe 15 minute look, but I cannot get away with this every single day of my life like I need more than just this, but somehow it just comes together and works. But do you see the difference that just those two shades made, it just gave a little bit of dimension to the eyes and the eyes It looks so forgotten about and that's going to take a stiff little definer brush and just hit it with a dark brown shade. And then I'm just going to so lightly and effortlessly just hit the top of my lashes or right like this. And that's literally at fresh shadow. boom, done. Okay, so for eyebrows, I'm going to go in with the anastasiia Brow Definer. I use a shade medium brown as a brand new one. I either do this or I do the brow pomade. It doesn't really matter. I go back and forth. I'm going to hit it with this today. And I'm going to do my eyebrows so natural, you're going to be a little shook because I'm going to basically not touch them. I'm just going to Fill in little gaps that I have, the more like you want to be the further down you want to hold your tool. If it's a makeup brush, if it's a wand, like you're casting spells, the more likely you want to be hold it down a bit lower. If I'm going to hold up here, we're going to get much more pigment and a lot more intense. So I'm holding it down low and then just doing little sweeps. No mama needs to trim these brows do. And that's it. I didn't even touch the whole brow and not touch the inner corner I literally just filled in little spots throughout it that took me I'm not kidding 20 seconds to do. And that's it. You can see the difference between this and this just as far as definition but we do not want to start filling this in so aggressively that now we take away the femininity of like the blessing cheeks blessing, the blessing, the mercy cheeks and the bronze skin all that we want to keep it nice and light and feminine. So we don't wanna get too heavy handed on the brows. My left brow always gives me problems, but he's more like your sister. If I don't set my eyebrows and I leave the house. It's like that's all I could think about all day. I'm like Oh my god Am I constantly in the mirror like combing them properly because I want my brows to sit a certain way and only like super glue makes that happen. So that's why I use an aggressive amount of eyebrow gel. So now before I go on with mascara, I'm going to set my face because I don't like to set my face after I have mascara on as of recently especially I'm doing this look because then my mascara bleeds so I'm going to go in with an oily base setting spray. I typically use the Morphe setting spray but for this look I actually prefer to go in with something that's a little bit more do we so I'm going to go in with the Pharsalia rosegold skin mist, the Tata dewy luminous skin Mrs. Great Delilah be a glow face Miss is great. This is just what I have right now in front of me. So I'm going to go and with this and just cover my entire face. And then depending if I feel like I'm still not as good as I want to be, I'll go in with a second layer or a third or seventh You guys I'm working on settings right now that is Oh, bitch. So I'm gonna say this oh bitch You should name it oh bitch can I'm going to set my face with Oh batch. That sounds pretty good. It's got like a little ring to it you know, honey that glow is coming through my mistake All right you guys so no i i have been trying to get this to dry for five minutes I don't understand what's happening. I've been using this spray for so long and I've never ever ever seen it make me look this dewy. Like when I say do I'm oily like Look at me. Look at how aggressive that is like it's intense like, I've never ever gotten this oily from it before. And it's not wanting to dry and I'm like what's going on and I want to go in with my sponge and dab it out. But I know that if I do it over my cheeks, it's gonna destroy my blush and bronzer so I'm kind of stressed right now. Oh, crap. Oh, bad things already happening. All right, you know what, this is great. This is a good video because you guys are gonna see what happens when you get up and we're fixing our ups. Okay, okay, all right. That's better than the side. The side is aggressive but now we are a little patchy over here. That's all right. Everything's gonna be okay. This is not bad, it's just not good. Okay, so at this point what I have done is I have gone over my entire face obsessively with my damn beauty sponge and then I put a little bit more of the Kat Von D pattern is under my eyes because that setting spray broke it up so much. And now I'm going to go back in with a little bit of that Chanel bronzer because it kind of ate my bronzer away. So I'm just going to put a little bit of that on to warm my cheeks back up and I will say that I can't be the sponge is like I've said a million times the saving grace when it comes to makeup. So make sure that you've got a good beauty sponge you can rely on and I'm just putting this back over the cheeks This is definitely helping and then again, beauty sponge. Okay, so we've definitely got to a better place for sure. So all I did was dab everything out with a damp beauty sponge and I lit a little bit more of the Kat Von D on dry powder right here in the under eye because it just broke up so much. And I took a little bit of this concealer right here is put it down here. And I literally blended it out with a brush like this because it was just looking so choppy and awful. blend it out, and then back in with a little bit more of the cream bronzer. And that's what I did. And now there's no patchiness there's a little bit of like, it's kind of like looking a little separator on my nose, but nothing crazy. So I'm not going to wash my face. I actually want you guys to see that it happens and make up and it's not always perfect and you just got to roll the punches and learn how to fix it. So now what I'm going to do Hopefully I don't destroy my makeup. But in order to keep that glow on my cheeks without going in and adding a powder highlight because I want to keep things creamy and amazing. I'm going to go in with the Smashbox primer oil I've shown this trick before, it has not failed me yet. I put a little bit in the back of my hand, just like three drops. And when I'm going to use all those three drops because you will destroy your makeup. If you do that. You take your sponge right here, you dab you get it covered. And then you just want to like go around your wrist, your skin and make sure that you barely have anything on there like you just want the tiniest amount of that oil. And then I'm going to do is go in to those areas where I said it was looking patchy. Oh yeah, so much better. And I just dab it out just a little bit. And that's it. And you can see just gave me a really nice glow in there. And I just fixed the imperfections. It just took what was patchy and just made it look like into the skin. So we're gonna do that. I'm Both sides. Do not overdo it. You can see I'm literally barely touching it just a little bit and then you move on. That's it. So now we have like that really pretty glow back to the skin right there. So my favorite mascara as of recently I went on a mascara hunt and bought like probably 10 to 12 mascaras there were all like top rated mascara at Nordstrom and Sephora. And I've been trying a lot of them and I'm obsessed with this Lancome one. It is so amazing. I know it's very popular. It's called the Monsoor big I think it's called but I'm so picky about mascara as you guys like you know me if you've watched my channel I've stuck to the same mascaras for five years and this one is amazing and I just go straight in with it. I don't even feel like I need to go in with a bass beforehand. I just go in. When you first put it on, it can look really clumpy but if you just keep working it, it makes your lashes so voluminous and thick. Obsessed. Okay, so now for my lower laughs I'm going to go in with the same thing as always, the Mac cosmetics extended play gigbag Giga black lashes where that is a tongue twister for me. Okay, so I'm just having a bad lash day. So that's cute. You know, we can't get realer than this right? This video is just this is the realist. Once again the concealer is oxidizing and it is not matching my net perfectly and I'm very fussy about it because my neck is definitely more yellow golden and this concealer is oxidizing to a much pink year tone. If you can see it on camera. I'll give you a double chin gaze yet Oh man, that was rough. You know that was rough. I would still leave the house looking like this. It's not like I'm like, Oh, this is trash. But there's just been a lot of bumps in the road today. And that's why I'm going to upload this video because that's life. So for my lips, I'm gonna go in with the lip pencil sweet tea by Morphe. I love this lip pencil and it's inexpensive. I know this is like a fan favorite. This is one of the most popular shades music just like a beauty Neutral was a brown undertone. If you're super fair, like when I'm super fair, I don't die for this because it's brown when you're really really really pale, but you got a little color in your skin. It's amazing. I put it on the outer edge and I take my finger and just slide it along. Now I'm not flipping you off, unless you deserve it. Then that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm gonna go in with the shade nude lust by Maybelline and put that all over the lip. Let's put that right on top all over that liner. Then I'm going to go in with the Chrissy Teigen and Becca cosmetics lip gloss in the shade beachbum just such a pretty like nude, a little brown undertone in it. Okay, so now that I have gone where my face is so much with a beauty sponge, I'm definitely much more matte than I intended to be because of all the issues that we came across. So because of that, I'm going to go in with a little bit more of my mood light but I'm going to go in with the shade. This is carrots. Yeah, I'm going to go with the shade care. It's right here, which is one of the lighter ones, but it's still got a little color to it. But I'm just gonna put a little bit of it on the cheek area, just lightly and then just take that up towards. I'm just dropping things. I'm a mess today. This is just I need to be done. I'm gonna take that up a little bit on the nose. Okay, so like that might have saved my life. I'm gonna do something very risky. And it might completely destroy this look at my complete destroy the entire video, but I don't care i'm going to do it. I'm going to go in with the Lyla be a glow face mist, I'm going to spray it just on the cheeks, the cover of my eyes, and just spray it down here. Okay, I'm gonna break my own rule. And since I just applied a powder highlight, I'm going to go in with a little powder blush just because this look is supposed to be blushy and it's not blushy and it's making me a little crazy. So we're gonna put on some blossoms using a few different shades from MAC, just kind of mixing them up. See how this goes Oh god, I'm just, I'm rich. I'm over it. Hello. It's not getting much better than this. That's a lot of mush. Okay, you guys that is it for us and we're going to call this video at this point this um show of an everyday makeup routine. I was not expecting for that, that setting spray to do that. All I know is that definitely really took a toll on my face. I definitely fixed it, but it's still not the look that I was hoping for. In the end. It's typically much dirtier than this and much bulkier than this. I don't feel like it's as fresh as I want it to be but it's real life. And I feel like this video is perfect for the quarantine because it's just like these are the kind of things that are happening right now sitting at home bored playing with makeup and you're like damn, why doesn't it work like it normally does. You know, try to have fun with it. Don't get too frustrated. I know it's easy. When you put a lot of work into your makeup and then something bad happens. It's so frustrating but it's just makeup. It's supposed to be fun. It's supposed to enhance what you're feeling. So just go with it. That's it. I'm done preaching. I love you guys so much, but you enjoyed the video. Stay safe, stay home, and I'll see you guys soon. Bye Walmart Oh come back focus on me

_A0P1kilpjE.txt,"Everybody, thank you for watching. I'm so excited about today's video because it's been a little bit since I've done like a natural, everyday type of makeup look, I know I love doing like full contour highlight and all that good stuff but I also really love a quick, easy natural routine. So in today's video I partnered with necks to showcase some really big trends for summer which are bushy brows, both freckles and just like really glowy skin. So if you guys want to see how I got this look right here then please keep watching start off today's Look, I'm going to be using the cover effects word or cloud primer. I'm going to be mixing a little bit into pay hands and applying it over my face. So I want to use like a hydrating primer for today's look because I want it to be like a really fresh, natural look or foundation. I'm going to take a little bit of this stellar Foundation and the color s 10. Just getting two pumps because I only want a little bit, it's actually maybe more than expected. So it looks a little bit off, but once it's planted and I've used this color, a lot of times, I'm just gonna wipe off any of the excess because I'm probably gonna just use one pump. By applying it with your fingers, it's going to give you like a more natural finish, it's going to just kind of like blend nicely into your skin and it's going to actually look like your skin which is nice. So as you can see, I have some darker spots from the sun where your sunscreen. So what I like to do is I have this cream concealer, this one's by Krylon and I'm just going to click a little clean brush and just apply it has like a little bit of like a salmon undertone, so I'm just gonna apply that with any like the dark spots. Just kind of blend in with my finger like lightly You can see it covers it right up, we just want to use a very light hand. And then we're gonna go to powder after. So for underneath my eyes, I have a little bit of some like dark circles. So what I like to do is I like to mix the color cream which I just did for the dark spots along with alabaster. And I'm just going to take a little bit of each and just lightly tap it under my eye. You can use your finger as well, I feel on a bar use my finger it was just like a smoother application. So if you want to do like that more natural look and have it look like your skin. I feel like because it warms up the product with your fingers. It's just a little bit more natural again. So now to set the little bits of concealer. I'm using the LA Girl pro face and I'm just gonna take a little bit with this fluffy brush and just tap it underneath my eyes. Just a little bit With a very light hand. So for today's natural look, I wanted to do a really fluffy brow and some full freckles. So, I'm super excited to be showing you guys the film fluff, I wrote pencil. what's so cool about this, I definitely never heard of anything like this before. So I was really excited to review this for you guys. It's an eyebrow pomade pencil. So if you guys are familiar with a palm, it usually comes with like a little jar if you use a pencil, but this eyebrow brush actually comes with the pomade on the end of it and has this really cool tip and it's perfect for a nice bushy, natural looking brow. And on the other end, there's a micro paddle brush, which is to fluff brush and blend your brows. So I got to play around with this for the past couple of days and just the brush alone it really does fluff up your brows. So I'm gonna zoom in a little bit so you guys can see this in action. But I'm really excited to show you guys posts right now bushy brows are really in so I feel like a nice Natural love bushy brows like perfect for the summertime. So first I am going to just brush my eyebrow hairs up. I'm going to go in with the palm and then I'm going to go back and with the fluff brush it's gonna blend and fluff the product into your brows. So this like texture This brush is super interesting because it really does like fluff up your eyebrow hairs which is crazy. So when you go in with the pommy and and Phil and shake my brows Can you want to use this with a very light hand and also I'm using this in the color espresso it does come one shade darker. If I was doing like a full normal space routine where I do like a lot more makeup I'd probably go in with the black, but since I'm doing like a more natural look, I'm going to go in with the espresso. And that's like this waxy texture to it. But again, it makes your brows look supernatural. You guys know, I've been using NYX products forever. So I love a good, affordable brow. It's now going to take the fluff end. And I'm going to start fluffing my brows and pushing up the pomade into the ground to make it look super natural. And because the pomade has like that waxy finish, you don't need a bro. Like a settings setting gel or anything like that. Because this right here, it's going to help keep your eyebrow hairs in place, which is also really cool. I love it. I love this little brush. It's so cool. So you can see my natural brow versus the fluffed one which still has like that very natural look to it, which I love. So let's do the other one. Like the front part of my eyebrow, do you do a very light stroke, it's gonna give you like the perfect, fake like hair so it's gonna look like you're drawing your hairs again so very light hand. Now we got some bushy brows. Next up, I'm gonna take a bit of this cooler Tom bronzer, and I'm gonna actually mix the two. And I'm just gonna contour a little bit like to go like all the way pretty much cover my whole forehead, bronzer. Five hat I should say, please make fun of me grab when I was younger especially and just don't care anymore. I left my forehead Thank you so much. Don't forget to do your ears. And then next I'm going to go in with this Creme de Scala by Natasha didn't Wanna take a little bit on my finger, dab it onto my hand and then pile up on my cheeks. Go really pretty natural blow my nose and a little bit under my brow. I'm gonna do a little bit of that same contour color and just do a little bit on my nose because I just personally love to do it. You don't have to do it of course, as precise as maybe just took a quick one or presumably we need to country knows that. I'm going to take the same contour shades and just to look a little bit into my crease. I feel like whenever I do this, it just makes my eyes a little bit more awake and open, which I really like. Just a little bit. A little bit goes a long way. I'm gonna see that same brush on you a little bit on my lower lashline as well. What I also like to do same cream highlighter, multitasking, He's everywhere to give you like that extra glow. I'm gonna take a little bit of this brown powder from my bronzer and just apply a little bit on the outer my eyelid I like to apply shadow underneath my eyes because I feel like it makes them look more open and like rounded. like it'd be smile and you see where your natural creases that's where I would Just putting the shadow down itself so I haven't decided if I want to do lashes maybe just on the outer. So I'm going to do a little bit of a scarf first and then I'll decide. So I'm using this next on the rise volume of scara I love the brush of this. These are my favorite brushes I don't like like the fluffing brushes I like the ones that are like this that really separate the lashes. I don't love my lash extensions probably like a week or two ago. Whenever I do, I always have like much thinner lashes and it's not because they take my lashes out it's because I have that problem when I pick them. So that's why sometimes I need to throw like a little bit of a ship lash. On one end up growing back. Next one it take a little bit of this cream blush. This is Charlotte Tilbury. I'm gonna do the same thing where I mix it on the back of my hand. This is a good base for the freckles we're going to do in a little bit. So it's gonna have like something for it to stick to. I'm also gonna apply some blush on my nose. Because you have like a nice suntan, your nose always gets a little bit pink. Of course my dark spots back I'll look like a frog. Okay, so now for the full fractals. I'm going to do a couple different methods to do a full Frankel video probably two or three years ago, but I'm going to take the next micro brown pencil and espresso to start and I'm going to start doing little dots, little freckles spread away. I'm gonna do a freckle over my tux perfectly to cover it up. Another method that I'm going to also do, I was eyebrow powder. This one's also my next I'm just gonna take a little bit on the spoolie. I'm gonna, since I have that cream blush already, it's perfect. I'm going to just apply this over and lightly tap it. I like to do a little bit at a time because I have tried this before and screwed it up. And that's not what I want to do. So it's so funny because I've talked to people that have real freckles that I've seen, like this trend that's been going on forever, and they're like, Why? It's always like, you won't make it home, you know. So now with this brush, I'm just gonna lightly Push sticks to the cream blush that I did. And then I'm going to now go in with actual pomade and a super tiny brush and do some darker freckles. So, I like using a bunch of different things that way. They're all kind of like different sizes, different colors. Take a little bit more, the cream blush. A little bit on my lips. And for letter music, vintage by and large Gosh add a little bit of a lash. I'm going to cut my Christina w SPS. I'm still on the outer edges of my eye. So I'm going to cut these in half. I like these because they're super super natural. Sounds like a little bit more dimension model. I'm gonna keep no mascara on my bottom lashes. I'm gonna do a little more or less a little. I'm gonna do a timeout on my island. So this is the final result. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I really love how like natural and fresh this makeup looks. And honestly I'm like all about these phone calls. I haven't done them in a while and I've actually kind of missed them as I do. Where we get the younger we want to look and I feel like this look right here is like perfect for exactly that. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Thank you so much for watching and until next time, I'll see you guys later

I'm so excited that it's my turn that I can buy her outfits because I feel like she chose really good ones because I know it's there. Sure. And sometimes it's hard to find things there. So I'm kind of nervous. I'm excited to see what she's going to choose for me so Casey is going to go shopping and then I'll get to see the outfit. Hey guys, I just drove to the thrift store. I'm gonna go inside and also I wanted to tell you guys that I just got a car this is my car and I drove I'm so happy Oh my goodness. I want to show you guys my car. So let me know if you ever want to see like a video on that. Anyways, besides that, I'm gonna go inside find outfits for the entire week for JC to where I'm kind of nervous because that's a lot of clothes, and I usually am so picked thrift stores. So let's see if I can find stuff. I have been looking around everywhere to find like a normal black shirt, and there's a lot but like they just have designs on them. And I ended up finding this one. So this is going to be my first outfit. And I just have to find like short skirt or jeans to pair with this, so I'm gonna have to find that. But right now I'm going to start with the shirt. I found this but it's not my favorite, but I can't find anything else though like it's cropped at the I hate stripes. I don't know. We'll have to see Oh, it's just so it's harder than I thought it was gonna be. Oh, I'm looking around and I found this shirt and it's like the life is good one and it's really cute. It's just go with the flow. So cute. But like that's besides like my outfit. Like I found this like normal black shirt, but it's kind of boring. Like I need a fun like you're having a tough time, guys. I don't know how JC did this. The tank top section is so hard to look through because they're all flowing and I'm trying to find like, like a tight one. This is the only one I could find. It's not my favorite color. Because it's so white and I have such like light skin like I feel like that's not like a really good color for me to wear. But I mean, I'm giving us a JC so to get off to where it's so hard to find something but this is the only time when I could find she could like roll it. I know it's really long. It's from Forever 21 it's kind of cute. It has a V but I have to find like shorts but with that maybe something else I don't know that mannequins kind of scary. I don't want to spoil the outfits.

It's velvet, but it has a lot of buttons like q flashpay. That was one of like the tops that I got. Now, I should look at jeans. They have such a heat selection here, but I think I'm going for black jeans and wow, there's actually a lot of black jeans I could choose from I know I said black jeans, but I just found these really cute gray ones. And they're high waisted, which is perfect because most of the things that I got are kind of drop. So you know, pair this with one of the tops, gray jeans. I like them a lot. They're like big too. They're not like skinny jeans like I feel like that's in right now. So it's those and then I want to try looking at like, shorts but like flowy shirts like I feel like Be really cute to pair with one of the tank tops that I got. I just found these flowy shorts that I really like. They're colored and I think it would go really good with this tank top that I got.

Yeah, we could probably fix those but this is super cute with the red and black I like it a lot. It's so cute on you. Even though this outfit is a little uncomfortable to wear. I do like it a lot. Okay, good cuz I was really trying without What? I was trying to make it more in your style a little bit. I like it for this next outfit. It's Wednesday, and I was actually going for something she would wear. I personally wouldn't wear this because she's insane. She likes flowy skirts and she doesn't have one she wants one.

_mc6zGfJ9FU.txt,"There's like those filters and then there's just there's like me and Gabby, though, do you want to be affectionate sisters for 24 hours or try to be affectionate? Hey guys, I'm Nikki and I'm Gabby. And there's some sisters that are raised like super like, Oh, I love you. Or they kiss each other goodbye. Or like, hang out together like for fun. There's those kind of collar sisters to see. To see. Yeah, there's like dough sisters, and then their sisters like me and Gabby. They're like, yo, Like what? Like, hi. sisters have been bickering over the last. She started attacking me in her comments. Now it just reminds me of this drama. So it's an audio. It's literally not worth it. We want to change it up for this channel. Obviously on this channel, we do a lot of challenges. We come up with a lot of challenges, and we came up with this idea. Dia to be the opposite of what we are as sisters. We want to be affectionate sisters for 24 hours or try to be affectionate way back five years ago, five years ago, we made a sister's expectations versus reality has like a million views. It's like one of our most popular videos on our channel and we decided we want to try all the expectations without doing the reality. Try them actually try them. Let's see if it works on a relationship. Let's see if we feel different towards the end. Okay, let's go. So the first affectionate thing we're going to do together is go have a date. Not like a date date but a coffee date. There's no Duncan you're going to Starbucks. Thank you for my rice krispie treats sister. Feed me Like a face mask you know instead of getting coffee, we totally should have gotten together because that's something we both bond over everyone on my channel when I was going through this phase where it was like, why she she got stung by a bee. I'm like even talking and our coffee date is cut short because of course we get yelled at for filming. People do not like cameras in their stores or places I guess we believe now. We just got yelled at. So we got kicked out of Starbucks that did not last long. newsflash, I always filmed in Dunkin and there's never an issue. You got me hooked up Duncan I used to be Starbucks girl. Well, this is something we're binding over. Do you got me hooked to Dunkin? I like Dunkin because of you so well. Now we are in the parking lot outside of the pole dancing place. So now we're going pole dancing. I'm really excited. We are going to share this sister activity together. I hope you don't get annoyed with how flashy m&e I'm more A special outfit under my sweatshirt on take Instagram pictures in my little stripper outfit on the pole game. Wait, what are we, together with? Whoa, that's actually cute. Okay, let's go. We love feeling hot and feeling ourselves. So I think this is the perfect activity for us to be honest. We were a little something. Oh. I was like can I turn up music a little bit? Yeah, here, we can make this shining. I used to dance back in the day. So I didn't realize your body kind of like saves muscle memory. And you just kind of pick back up even though I haven't danced and like probably were five years three. I look over and Gabby's like in the sparkly heels, bar. Title outfit. I feel like she's having fun feeling hot doing this. She's really feeling herself. It's just so painful honestly, like it's, it's a lot of work. There you go. I get so fed up with the heels and the fishnet. I just take them off. They're getting in the way of me actually being able to do cool things. What did you think about the pole class? I thought college should be the second videographer watching. I was jealous. I saw how neat was looking at you. Really? I saw that. Kiss me know. Nate, let's make her own profession. You know, I can fire my employee. Okay. So now we're on our way to go sister shopping and have a sister shopping spree. Nikki and I have not gone shopping together and so long and we're shopping for matching outfits. We have an appointment at JC Penney at the portrait studio. Are we supposed to match? I feel like we should get like corny like the thumbnail of our sister expectation versus reality video insert here like a match like do like a 2.0 version. Usually when I'm shopping for photoshoots I like to go very extra and bold and this is definitely different for me. I hate skinny jeans I like straight like pants like these why we have to wear jeans like that. I can't really wear skinny. This is gonna take so long. I hate skinny jeans. I like bell bottoms or straight like, I'm just like walking around American you go like, what am I doing in here? I got mom jeans and she got skinny jeans. Same thing Gabby said we have to get cream sweaters so so now we're on our way to our sister photoshoot to take affectionate sister photos. These photos for like our parents like sister photos. We have to back options and we chose to an outdoor boat outdoor bokeh. It kind of looks like a spring. It's like a school photo. Sister photo poses a guarantee they're gonna be cheesy. Gabby stand with your arm like this I want to see and then I have to go like that does not look natural at all. Look, it looks good in here. So the photoshoot i think is going pretty good. I think the last time we took photos like this was when we were like five wait moms are gonna seriously love you. So we're just doing all these like cheesy senior portraits. was last time you guys did this like 1999 I think Nikki and I Loki look like a couple during this photo shoot and it's weirding me out. Especially since a lot of you guys ship us Or like all you guys that are new think we're a couple are not twin. So now we have to hug you guys know it's weird. I don't know why it's weird. It's like It's like I'm hugging myself go Oh, just heard each other back here. These photos are very cheesy. Oh my god, I'm excited to see these looks like we're on The Bachelor fighting for the rose. Well that's, you know that's cute Can you good So we're gonna end this challenge last day with having a sister spawn I I feel like Gabby and I have common ground with that we love to love ourselves and take care of ourselves. bodies are my thing. I think this is going pretty good and I think we should do bodies or nights more often. This whole sleep over thing is chill and I think Nikki and I's relationship is always put in like such a strong setting. Like, it's good to have a relaxing setting for once. I'm surprised Nikki and I didn't fight today. I thought I saw it coming in the beginning when we got coffee, but it didn't happen. Alright guys, so that was our sister bonding. Yeah, I don't even know what this was. But let us know in the comments below if you guys thought it was a success, or if you didn't think it was a six 700 Oh, it's not based on them. Do you think it was a success? Yeah, I know my confessional. Yeah, I said, I think it's just it was a success because we didn't fight. Wow, you're right. The only thing we really fight over is like filming like times and schedules but like other than that we have fun together. That's why I said like, when I hang out I think he is always like with friends, but like we've never hung out one on one because it's like, you know, like, you work with each other. It's, you know, you It's complicated. Those subscribers who are older and maybe have business with your sister definitely understand. It's like when you're in a relationship and you see each other too much. It's like, you start fighting over the dumb stupid shit when you take each other for granted. And I think being sisters and working together This is weird saying work cuz it doesn't feel like work. But, you know, we do like go to meetings together and we do travel together and we do a lot together. And I feel like when it's a lot, you just start to nitpick. And I feel like had we gone to different colleges and like really had different experiences. We definitely would still be best friends and not have this stuff going on. For sure. And I hope this video shows you guys that we do care about a relationship and we are always trying because sisters are the friends you're born with and you have them for life so it's important be sure to hit subscribe and click the bell if you guys want to be the first people to see our 2020 uploads. We have a lot of different content coming this year. I'm excited. I enjoyed this. This was fun. Yes. And we will see you guys in our next video. Happy Valentine's happy balanced twins month.

0J44snY3lbY.txt,"Hi, everyone, if you're new to our channel, I'm JC and I'm Casey and today we're gonna be doing our mom's makeup for Mother's Day and we have never done her makeup before because she usually doesn't wear makeup. So this is a first and we're really excited to see how it turns out. So let's get started. We're back with our mom and I don't think we've done a video with our mom just alone by the gymnastics video. Yes, but today we're gonna be doing her makeup. And it's not really a full makeover just like you know, adding on some makeup because I like how her hair is today and she's just wearing a black shirt, so not a full makeover. Hi guys. I'm really excited to see what how they do my makeup today. I'm very excited to see how it looks because I've never seen my mom with makeup before. I know she usually just wears it natural. Yes, she does not wear a lot of makeup at all. So I think we should just get right into it. I'm gonna be doing this side of her face. I'm gonna be doing this side. So it's kind of like a competition and you guys can decide who did a better job at the And I think I'm gonna win I think I'm going to I don't think so. But it's fine so we're gonna start off with some foundation it's cold definitely cold Oh it looks like your color Why is it blending better than my own foundation? We is it getting blended although I don't want to put too much on because when I do Jaycees makeup I make it so key. Yeah, honestly I feel like a cake after you do it, so we're gonna still keep it like unnatural luck. I guess you're gonna do the nose right? No, yeah, that's like your part. It's literally in the middle. I'll do the chin and you didn't notice what I literally just said I'm gonna do the chin and cheek kind of just went for it. Okay, I guess I'll just do the line on the nose. When we finished the foundation. That's probably the easiest part. You can't even see like a difference probably not For concealer. Oh, honestly, I think you need to do both sides. No, I'm not gonna concealers. Can you please Please do my second Whoa, nevermind. She's spending so much on that's not even like you just put it under your I don't put a lot of concealer on at all but like I don't want to put a lot on I just want to die. Does anyone else do that? You know? No, Casey's better at blending and you don't like you're taking it on? I know nearly cake. I don't know really how it feels. Okay, now we're going to use setting powder. I'll go first this time you got to get a lot on because it sets the foundation and concealer don't you? Wait, we're supposed to do a bronzer contour now. Yes, contrary before powder Honestly, I'm not sure which one goes first, but we're gonna do it this way. Just Yeah, I think I just put so much powder on this brush. So stop. That's way too much. What do I do? I can't get it off. She can like hit it. Yeah, CAKE CAKE CAKE. Oh, that's so high. shine like it really just like is cool. Okay, it took it makes her case Matt I guess it's good. Oh, I want to do my makeup now I never really do it like this where I put like you know powder over the foundation. I don't even wear foundation to school. Do you know I wear like nothing to school Yeah, cuz I just want to be comfortable and not have my makeup come off at school you know, right don't wear a lot of makeup anyway. No, no. I really like contour. I'm just horrible at it. Like I'm gonna take you know, tips from Casey and try and like learn how to take this color. hair. How much are you putting on a little bit? I'm learning. Oh, she's really going for it. Like you find the cheekbone is anyway. You know, the problem though is I'm on this side. So it's gonna be like this, whereas you can just go you know, it's Smell oh no I smell that your forehead is dark on one side and another side is like wow we can tell that and I'm not notching yours I want to do it in a more natural look. You have to match it when you see it What did you do you like me to line upwards like why I thought you like outline upside didn't I do a good job? Wow I literally think I'm doing good. Here's JC side. Oh, there's nothing here cheesy side. There's nothing there's nothing there. What do you mean I definitely made her look like she just got a tan. We're gonna use blush. Now I'm going to use the shade exposed because I feel like it's close to the contour color. I really want to use this brush for the blush. I've seen it in videos, stab God where I put a lot of blush. I don't want to use the same color as her. I really like the color she chose. Excuse me. So different colors for different Inside oh my goodness so much comes off in like one dab Why are you using a fan brush you're literally crazy I'm just brushing it off no uses a fan brush when when do you not use a fan brush like I use it on everything looks so wrong oh my gosh Am I doing again? Perfect you're putting in her highlight final use what you used I don't think this is a really definite like was she don't even tell wow okay so blushes done bronzer Stein contour JC Oh my site is looking more natural in yours basically I don't have enough makeup on. Next are the dye brows. Yes. And I'm gonna use this tart Brown. I'm not using that I'm using this wet and wild ultimate brow retractable brow pencil. So it has this like end on it where you can rush the hairs Then so so it is mine but this is what has the color oh but this side has an actual like pencil okay there goes the cap so I'm gonna brush the eyebrows hey I'm on the awkward side you're not it's like your eyebrows are already so dark so this is not really helping if brows are kind of looking sharp a little sharp oh they look so dark now and Cora Davina everyone thinks her mom looks like Carla del v Do you see it? I don't know I see it looks like the dark eyebrows but like she doesn't have the dark eye shadow on media should do that maybe so you can see the difference. I think I shot it was nuts. Oh yeah, I know it's not so this is the part we're going to be using from tart and I got this ready crush crush mesh Christmas and there's so many different colors in it to choose from I kind of want to do like a red theme we're gonna put on primer now for her I I want to skip that but I guess I can No, how is the eyesight I'm going to stick I'm just brushing on the primer. I'm not using any. I basically never used this palette. I always use this palette. I'm going to start with this color. I'm going to start with paradise paradise the pretty color. Oh, this is so dark. I'm gonna start in a corner and then go out with your sisters. You do it however you want to. I really want to get good at like eyeshadow. You know? Casey is pretty talented on it. I mean, I guess I think Yeah, but not really. I wouldn't know what to do. Yeah, it's really hard. And she's like getting onto your iPhone. I think hey, it must feel like I'm just like stabbing finger poking. You can't feel it all the way. Right? Because it's going to the lid first. And then yeah, I don't know how to blend. Like there's some really don't I don't know what I'm doing. You know, like sometimes it'd be like that. I'm really proud of you. Good Casey yes very nice look good I can't I think my side actually looks good. Oh my side looks better Yes it does. So here is the eye shadow look right arrow mine is kind of dark I added black I was just experimenting and this is what it looks like which was better I think mine does my no I definitely mine because I made it a little more natural than you did yours is more salt glam all the way hers was more smoky mine is more peace natural. Okay, Nexus eyeliner I'm gonna do a really quick liner. I'm not going to add a wink because that's too green. I would preferred if case you do my side so we might just shoot here, right? No, okay. She's not gonna do it for me. Nevermind guys. Basically Casey side is very thick. Just watch the expert I was trying to get on or what do I do? Scary draw liner. Did I do a better job than Casey? Oh? Because I messed up okay, it is a thinner line and it definitely looks better. So I think I won the eyeliner. No. So there's kind of a black line didn't show up and drying it wasn't dry but it's okay. It's fine when I think about makeup sorry. Okay, so this is my I am did a pretty good job on the spin eyeliner. And I think I won this round. So next step is mascara.

-W0Du80k6Tw.txt,"Hey guys, welcome to today's video we're going to be testing out youtubers makeup. This can be an influencer that collabed with a major brand or an influencer that has their own brand. It's kind of a mix. It's a little bit 5050. But I have a big been and I've kind of pulled things aside that I've wanted to try out and support and explore. And I felt like the last one of these that I did went over so well where I just tried so much of, you know, everything full face and you guys really enjoyed it. It's been a hot minute since I've done one of these. And there are a lot of really, really exciting new launches that have to do with people in my community and I just wanted to show some love and test things out. still give a little bit of a mini review and yeah, I guess we're gonna dive right in notice I get like kind of nervous when I say that, because I kind of feel like when you review a fellow creators product, you're kind of putting a hard spot you know, and I've said this before you either, you know say exactly how you feel and that gets you in hot water like you're ruining Someone's launch and you're just, you know, shame on you for doing that. Or if you're too lovey dovey with it, you're just fake phony and just trying to you know, get on someone's good side so it's a little bit tough to navigate this is probably the most challenging of videos like with brands, and I say this like as politely as I can, but with brands I feel like I can find the good and bad in all products. You know, occasionally there are products that I'm just like, oh, like next pass, but it's a brand it doesn't seem personal. It doesn't seem like someone that I'm going to go and make eye contact with at an event you know what I'm saying? So this is a little bit why am I doing this again, I don't even know it's really pretty. There's a lot of great makeup in front of me. I really wanted to put some of this to the test. A few things I have tried and used before. A few things are brand spanking new. We'll talk about it all. break it all down. And I also want to give my deepest apologies to make it by eemaan because I really love this blush palette. I don't I gave it fair justice in the video that I posted where I tried this on it was like a new at the drugstore video I will link that below in person. It did not look as crazy as it did in camera where the saturation picked up a little bit hotter. We're gonna play with this again I'm going to do everything in my power to like go lightly because I was also wearing a lot of bronzer underneath and it was bronzer that I didn't like so check out that video below if you want to see me with a lot of blush. So what we are going to do is make the skin look gorgeous play with Kristin Dominique. She has another new palette I still hadn't even tried this one and I'm like oh my gosh, another launch. Awesome for you like these palettes are really nice size. We're gonna play with this. We're going to play with a little bit of physicians formulas, so some higher end a little drugstore Of course I have some Huda Beauty just because you guys please tell me in the comments below. Am I losing my mind or is there not another brand out there? That is like face base. foundation that is by a creator like Who else is there? I'm spacing? Leave it in the comments below please, huh? Okay, so I want to dive straight into some Huda Beauty foundation she sent over some new colors for me because I think the one that I've been using is just a little too late. This is the shade toasted coconut I start building a house across the street and it literally sounds like it's like an earthquake It is literally like the house shakes like it's kind of making me a little bit nuts and like parking on my street all my gosh, if I seem tired and stressed it's a little bit of that little bit of construction a little bit of I woke up really early and went to the gym and went to bed very, very late. I don't recommend doing that. And yeah, I'm just like, I just need that makeup. I need the makeup so badly. Okay, but I do want to do is test out also this Huda Beauty face buff and blend complexion brush okay so I have it in the brush and I am just going to buff and blend and I'm going to really try my hardest. My very, very, very very very very very hardest to not overuse product which is so hard for me because in all things well not in all things but in so many things in life I'm like more is more. I say that a lot here on my channel. I'm like why not have just a little extra like the sprinkles on top, but maybe with your foundation you just don't you don't need sprinkles on top, you know? Alright, so this was the new shade they sent to me to try out It does look a little yellow. I did a test recently to see how product was oxidizing Huda products do oxidize. This one is Alright, so the other thing I've been doing recently is and I always say Just little things in my routine, I have actually been taking my foundation up underneath my eye and then I'm only using a tiny, tiny amount right in here and out on this edge where I have a little discoloration and I like it. It's one of the new techniques that I'm so into. And then I try to make sure I don't get too much makeup on the forehead. also part of the reason that I've changed up and I'm using this mirror right here is it is a magnification mirror. It's not like a crazy magnification but it is enough where you see a lot of things that you don't want to see but you need to keep it in your head that people don't look at you this close up. It really just gives you an opportunity to see what needs to be blended better where you need to adjust something so that you know from a normal distance you look so good. All right. I really do love this foundation. It's so full coverage. It's so light. It is so fragrant. That is the one thing that makes me lose my mind. And if I wear more than like three times in a row I do start to break out so that really sucks but I can usually get away with like one great killer makeup day. And that's why I continue to keep it on hand. Okay, moving into a product I know and love very well the Jeffree Star magic star concealer. I'm going to go in with C 13. And I'm just going to hit right in here. Right there. Just hit right in here. Oh my god, she's not doing triangles. Who is she? I don't even know. This is a new look. Such such such killer concealer. Oh my gosh. Okay, before I go into powder, I do want to try out a new blush that is a serum blush. This is by m cosmetics. I'm going to use the shade rose milk kind of looks like a little nail polish thing to do, right? It's cute. We're going to go in kind of the same way I do with the honest blush. My sister and I went to Target and got like a ginormous bag of candy corn. And as I'm sitting here, I'm like, like, fall is here. And I feel like every time I say that I am like nauseous or like, ooh, I have a headache or my like, everyone's like you're pregnant. Can we please for the love of God? I will tell you guys, I promise you, I will tell you guys, I mean, and even if I didn't, at some point, you'd be like, I'd be like, look a baby, you know, so you would know can't a girl just be nauseous and have cravings and be Moody, indecisive and tired? have a headache? Can't I just be a lot of things and not be pregnant? Does it mean that when I am pregnant, I get to be a lot of things and like that's the get out of jail free card like leave me alone. I'm pregnant. Leave us alone, you know, oh crap. I had wanted to use the Amman blush. Gosh, dang it. All right. Once that sinks in and I powder it I am going to put just a tiny Bit of the mind blush whoo I told myself I was not going to overdo the blush, whatever. I'm going to do it anyway I think it would look way better on like no foundation. Okay we are going to go on top and underneath the eye a little bit with some powder. I'm going to take my magic star translucent and I'm just gonna take a brush from Maloney that I've really really been enjoying. This is the all over blending. This is like a really nice multitasking brush. Nice Okay, we're now going to go in to some bronzer. I'm super excited because I forgot I had this on hand and I hope they still have this available and Casey I am so sorry that this got put in a bin and I did not get to give this a big hug publicly, you know sooner. I really hope they still have this available. This is the butter collection and Casey Holmes collaboration. You guys know how much I absolutely love the butter. bronzer so I thought this was just really fun, really cute. You get the fragrance in there you get a limited edition butter highlighter that actually looks like the perfect perfect shade. I'm excited. So I'm going to go ahead and start bronzing just ever so slightly and lately Okay, do you want to put just a teeny tiny bit of blush from the Amman palette I'm going to use just a tiny little bit on the tip of this brush and right in here and I am going to put on a little bit of the butter highlight. Oh my gosh, this is gonna be the prettiest thing ever. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and line my lips before we pull the camera forward. This is a waterproof lip liner from El Maki OSH and it's a collaboration with Carly Bible This is this shade Luna okay I'm going to go in with this shade I think this is just Bible. So I want to go on top of that with a Kristin Domini collaboration with Mac and this is just a gorgeous neutral tone seems like it would go really nice with this lip liner and then I will scoot you guys in. Can I please get a good lipstick application Phase I need to work on this I really liked this combo but I am in the mood to try as much as I can that's sitting in front of me. So I'm actually going to go in with Kristen Dominique liquid lipstick in beta. And I'm just going to put it on the back of my hand and apply it with my fingertip to kind of lighten up the center of the lip. This is from persona and this is the honey gloss. There's a lip trio. And I think they're really pretty. She also has a new eyeshadow palette that I was trying out and enjoying. I don't know where it wandered off to but she makes some really beautiful eyeshadows that are available at Ulta Look at that. Ooh, that is like a fall combo. I know that was a lot of steps but the darker brown lip liner with kind of a mob lip liner on top, something kind of neutral as far as a lipstick and then kind of lightened up the center and put a gloss on. Wow, that's a lot of steps. And that's super high. Maintenance but arrest me I'm high maintenance. I love how this looks. I can't keep my eyes off that lip combo that is so nice. Yes, I don't have a brow pencil from a creator influencer. I just don't. So we're gonna have to get creative with the Browns because they just don't have that. I'm going to go ahead and use this uptown brown and medium brown just with an angled brush. feeling pretty good about that. Not that I really need more highlighter but I am going to swing this brush right into the shade clutch from Pixi This is the collaboration with Rachel loves. And I'm actually just going to pull that kind of down and kind of pump up the Physicians Formula highlight just A little bit I am in the mood to be more than just lit from within. I want a glow. I don't have anything to contour my nose with. So I am just going to take a teeny tiny hit my contour palette from MAC, I'm just really not even doing much. I just kind of want to skim the side of the nose just to give a little bit of definition here. Okay, so now we're going to get into the fun stuff. I'm going to go ahead and prime my eyelids with something from Pixie This is the meriam and Pixie collaboration. This is the liquid fairy lights and this is just such an interesting, deep like Whoo, like look at that right I do want to hit this on top of the lid I of course need to lay down some shadow first we're going to go into the rustic glam palette and I am going to prime my eyelids with just the Huda foundation not even concealer. I'm just gonna kind of go right on top of the lids. I find that this is full coverage. enough that if you get straight into the eyeshadow before it has a time to really crease or settle or anything like that, it actually makes a pretty great eyeshadow primer. First things first I'm going to take my Scott Barnes six to brush and I'm going to go into this shade right here kind of all over just to set myself up for success in the crease. So this is going to be pretty low and I usually give like 123 wiggle on the outer edge and then back through the crease. And then I kind of stick around the outer edge backs where the crease Next I am going to go into the shade cactus will dangerous. I'm going to go in with this and kind of repeat the same motion, keeping it quite low. I really like this shade. It's super, super unique. I'm just not quite sure where to go from here. I think that's too too much. Huh, I really still wanted to use this somehow. Okay, we're just gonna be kind of adventurous. It's kind of fun. I actually really, really liked that combo and I'm now inclined to go into this green and kind of go right in the center. kinda nice. Now I want to work on the lower lash line, just an itty bitty bit. And to do that, I'm going to take a smudger brush from Zoeva. This is the two to six and I'm going to go into the brown and then I'm going to put a little bit of the teal on top of it. I just kind of want to define right through here. It through here and then buff it out. Okay, so this is one of those looks that looks like Oh dear God, what have I done until you get liner and lashes on so just hang tight, it's going to look gorgeous. I have a really good feeling about it. I'm actually going to take just a little bit of the bronze. I really like this. I think it's so different and peak hockey but just soft at the same time. I also want Want to highlight the browbone just a tiny little bit. I love that there's a nice cream shadow in the palette to do that. I'm going to take this just in the inner corner a little bit as well. I'm going to keep with the theme and we're going to use m cosmetics for our liner today. This is the illustrate of eyeliner. I've used this before I really enjoy it. I'm going to do just like the teeniest tiniest, little baby wing on both eyes, pile on the mascara and I'll be right back. Now I am going to load up my lashes. I really love how this I look turned out. All right, that's a lot of mascara. Wow, I did pull out some Lily lashes just in case. I have not worn a pair of these in a hot minute because I mean they are like vava boom these are the Miami's I mean part of me is like we're already this far just freakin do it right? Yeah, let's just have fun and do it. Oh, okay. love hate relationship with lashes runs so deep. I sometimes love them and I feel like it just takes everything to this very elevated, glamorous place and then other times I'm like, it just ruins a look. It takes away from it. It's too hard. Normally I do not like the Miami lashes from Lily lashes but I'm enjoying them today. I'm actually really I'm into it with This particular Look, I just I really like it. I'm so surprised. So this is where we land you guys. I hope you enjoyed me testing out a ton of different creators products whether it is a standalone brand or a new collaboration, a newer product or one that has been around for a minute, I just wanted to kind of do a full face using a bunch of that kind of stuff. So I actually super love where this all ended. Surprisingly, I will say one thing I wish I'd put this on at the very very end because there is minor Fallout that doesn't really bug me too much. But the only issue that I had with it is really my fault because once you put glitter on, you really want to let it be you don't want to be doing a ton of blending and I thought I was done. But then I got that itch. And I guess what I want to recommend and challenge myself is to wait to the end to put on your glitters, you know, and I'm actually going to put on just the tiniest bit more kind of just like tilt back yeah We'll see that changes Alright, there's so much more I could play with but I am actually just going to step away from the makeup because I'm at that point where if I put on more I think I'm going to ruin it. I would set my face with an orange creamsicle scented setting spray. I don't have that though. Just saying I don't I would support I don't have it. I think drama videos need to be made about that. I was sassing rich Lux for not putting me on his PR list I'm just gonna put some water on the face and he's cool down I need to cool down my entitlement. Oh, actually felt really really good. Okay, you guys this is it. I hope you enjoyed it. If you did give this video a thumbs up leave me some comments. Let me know what your favorite part was. I definitely recommend the new palette from Kristen Dominic. I'm gonna play with her newer newer one that is more galactic kind of bright duochrome neon pink, purple kind of a vibe. I really like the quality of her products. persona glosses are incredible that collaboration is a plus you guys already know I really love the Jeffree Star powder and concealer. The Huda Beauty I've already said my piece on that one Physicians Formula is always good among collab the rage loves club with Pixie, the Pixie eye glitters. It's all great. The collab mascara. Like literally the name is collab, so good. All right, you guys, I hope you're having a good one. Make sure you're subscribed if you have not yet done that, and then ring the bell so you're notified of my upcoming videos. I'm here three days a week, and I would love it if you guys would come and hang out with me again. All right, go have a good one. I know I'm gonna go have a good one with my glittery eyeshadow. I love it. All right. I'll see you guys in my next video. Thank you so much for watching.

So I'm giving A lot of powder like there's no option thing. So onstage How do you make sure that the makeup stays on like what's what's a couple of secrets? Um, setting spray is super important but also I sweat in my hair more than I sweat on my face so I'm really I'm one of those lucky ones that like really rarely I have to touch up my makeup. Like I can be on stage for like 45 minutes straight and like I'll have like a natural glow, but my makeup won't be like dripping you know? I'm really lucky like it's all in it'll be all in my hair. I had it really short. I saw I kind of want to cut it again. Oh god. I know it sounds crazy. Well I have to like first like I want to like go like workout and stuff and then like feel like boom then cut it and it's like the final like stamp of like the new look but i don't know i also love like the long hair.

One time we were watching a scary movie on the plane because I just feel like the monsters can get you on the plane. You're going way too fast for them to fly. That's what I'm talking about it. I'm not gonna watch them anywhere. But one time me and my manager sure and we were on the plane we were watching like, oh, was it the nun? Oh, yeah. Alright, so I was fine. But no matter I just hear the biggest scream everybody automatically turned towards us like what's going on? And she was like, she has this like really loud laugh to like, like kind of like a witch laugh like it's really loud when it like comes out like he can't stop it. She screamed and then realized that she screamed really loud. So then she starts laughing. Have people in the back bathroom? Yeah, when her scream but then to her laugh It was amazing. I was watching Coco because it happened out forever, but I'd never seen him didn't know what it was about. So I sit there and I'm like, Oh, this is so cute. And then as the movie progresses, I'm like, I'm gonna cry. Yeah. And then out of nowhere, I'm like bawling but like not a little bit. The ugly. The flight attendant comes to me, she's like, Honey, are you okay? And I go. I've had a couple episodes on on planes before. But you know, you get through them. That's the important thing, man.

Now tell me because you are very familiar with YouTube tell Yeah, I grew up in an era where I remember watching people like Bieber and artists like him doing covers before the fame before the big wave of like everyone's doing covers and so I was like, Well, you know, I had my little like MacBook and like photobooth on it and I just literally record covers on like my little photobooth app on my laptop. And then at 14 I kind of upgraded my swag a little bit. And I collab with these young kids who hadn't even graduated film school yet, right. And we recorded one of my first official covers, a song by Jay Z and Kanye West called It is and I don't even call it like low budget. I call it bro budget because we had no money. And I'm like 14, like with this crazy concept. And we're all just down for the cause I wrote to this really popular shooting location and I like called the poodle parlor. And a lot of very famous music videos have been filmed there. So we reached out to them and I had my cousin's as the extras, had them dress up like little hood lungs with all black. And we shot this music video in one take. And it was, I mean, to me one of the dopest coolest things, so it's still up. Yeah, yeah, you should check it out. This is actually like really crazy how I was like, I look back at it, and I'm like, I was only 14 and was always in there. And that video was the one that kind of changed the game for me gotten discovered. I got signed to a record label and then because of that, Mm hmm. What are you now 22 and when's your birthday March 2, since my birthday was Second time we get along so well, same day, same day. They know what time No. Oh, I was like, do you have the same one and we were born at the same time? Same moon, probably. I don't know. I haven't looked that deep into it. Maybe I should though. That will probably give me a lot of answers. And, Joan. Oh, no, too deep. Yeah. Okay, cuz at one point you become that person at a party that goes Oh, through Sagittarius tend to creating a nice spotlight smokey. I am and I'm turning up the drama Mama. So I'm just going in with the colors. No Spanish. She's gonna kill it. Do it. Do it. Got it. Got 50 thought, hey, nicer coffee. Yeah, okay. osito and, Lola. That's like my alter ego name. Oh, really? Yeah. When like Becky's, like really sad. And like, Oh, I'm sick and tired. Like I flipped the switch to Lola. And she's like the Boss bitch. That's like come on Becky get it together. Like in interviews when like Becky's, like backstage crying comes out in October. Yeah. Oh, you know? Yeah, that's so beautiful. Can people know that a lot? Um, I think in recent time, I've definitely opened up about my struggles with anxiety. Right? And it's obviously like a ongoing thing that takes a lot of work, and effort and especially when you feel like you're doing so many things for other people like something that was so sacred to you is now a job. So yeah, where do you find the balance? Where do you learn to say no, even though it's expected of you, maybe this is sacrificing my emotional or mental health or even physical health like, like my body literally, has been acting out in ways that it never has before. And it's because it's like, stop it. always comes back. Yeah. And so I used to think like, I'm not really good at just putting off my anxiety. And I was like, No, I'm not putting it off, I'm actually storing in a way for her to come back later. And so I think helping, what's been very helpful is opening up about that, because I realize like, I'm not the only one that goes through this. And I think it's important that people see even people who do what we do and live their life on, you know, some kind of platform. It's very easy to think that our lives are perfect, and that we have all the glitz and glam and the money and the fame and it's awesome. We have nothing to be sad about. But we're still human beings, you know, what they see? Yeah, well, it's filtered. You know, now in this growing, it's been a blessing and a curse growing up in this generation. It's been a blessing because it's allowed me the opportunity to explore the world and share my music with people who speak so many people different languages and lifts in so many different cultures and different places in the world, but at the same time, you're exposing yourself to the world, you know, at a percentage, it's a lot higher than the average person. Mm hmm. And that's also dangerous. You're putting yourself out there like that, and for people to judge and have certain comments on what it is that you choose to share. Yeah. So it's, it's been a learning curve for me. But I think one thing that I've learned is being authentic, being honest, like you, at the end of the day can sleep better at night, if you know you're that way. Like, I've never been one to love drama. Like I didn't go to high school. I was like homeschool. Mm hmm. And then I dropped out because I started working really young. Yeah. And I was like, my career is happening right now. Yeah. And as scary as it is to make a decision like this because I'm pro education like it actually it's really amazing. That, although school didn't really work out for me, because of my hard work, my siblings were able to attend better schools, right, and get better education. And that is their forte, and they're killing it. And it makes me so proud because now by the time my sister graduates, I'll have three to four months, because not all Frankie, Alex, Stephanie, and it makes me proud that like, you know, I was able to, like, live life, my path and be supported in that, like, it's not easy, I think, for anybody to come up with a decision like that at such a young age. Yeah. And then, you know, you're scared of what people are gonna say and what your parents are gonna think. But I was just like, I'm gonna do this. I'm committed and I'm not giving myself any other option than for this to work out. Like I'm really betting on myself. And the best education for what it is that I want to do is to live it to live life. You know, school made me feel really dumb. Like school made me feel really stupid and that was like, I think such a plus. of my childhood that still like makes me so awkward around like people my age because I never knew of it that's what I yeah. Oh my god the same Yeah, they really do unless like I have something in common which is like the industry or like creative passion like I hang out with like my normal cousins right and they're my family so I don't think about it but when their friends come around I'm like oh well you will preach in this is this is what happened so we added the auto yes to the center, sprinkled a little bit of Corona over it right here. And now we have this like spotlight smoky eye going on and I love it. So let's do a little bit of darkness on the bottom. So what is your most vivid makeup memory at a very young age? I would always play with my mom's makeup. Yeah, like It was like the Chola like era, where like very dark lip liners, very rich lipstick colors. And I'm super pro like do what makes you happy? What makes you feel like you're expressing yourself whether it's in the way you dress and the way you do your makeup. Male or female, like whatever it is that you choose to do if it's a true form of self expression, right, like do it and makeup was always one of those things for me since like very young. Although I look back on pictures. I'm like, Girl, that foundation didn't stop me. Why don't you beside me? Why did you put your eyebrows so much? I remember one time I got my bras and for the first time, and this lady was at least 72 years old. So that tells you enough, but my mom was like she's experienced. She got you and I'm back and I had like this one, you know? Oh, no, the little rainbow. I never cried so much. Watching Coco. It was not too Yeah, well Fortunately, I learned at a young enough age so they could back. Mine didn't. I would not be able to tell girlfriend because there's a lot of paint on here. I love the inner corner. Right. A little bit of Corona on the inner portion. Do you know what it means? It's beer. Right? Well, it's a type of beer but it also can mean crown. Oh, so this eye is shadow wise. Done. So I think now would be a great time to go off camera. Do the other I think Papa LaShawn we went glam honey. Be right back. Look at that. I am living for this look right now. So as I'm bronzing I just shared with Becky that I am like, I got invited to a really fun opportunity where I can be a voice actress. And I was like, have you ever done that before? And then she said no. But well, it's always been like a dream of mine to like, create really crazy characters. So I have like these different like little voices that I do. Like we got Susie's those is just like a really interesting person. She just talks like, about everything but like, just doesn't stop and it gets really annoying. Then we have met a bit before so sometimes when I really want something, I just talk like this and then I hope nobody gives it to me whatever. Oh my god, what do you Why are you getting it all that one works with it usually has to do with food. Right? You're really and he like, leaves a very healthy lifestyle and like it's been a good inspiration to me, but like, Oh no, like I just love food. Like I'll eat everything and anything and so when I'm around him, please like can I please up the Nutella crepe. And like if I do the baby voice I'll get it and it's great. And blush. I used to not be a fan of blush, but it really does. It's vital. Yeah, it's kind of came out of my toes. I'm like it's vital. The baby voice we're highlighting with schnoz. My favorite are using cheese myth in the sidebar headline. What she said? Cheese man means like the cheese mess like the gossip. Like, Oh, girl tell me the cheese man. I was like mozzarella sticks. This is a good highlighter girl. Look at that. She's beaming. Are we getting this on camera? are we are we getting Yes. Oh, what is it like for you? So as a musician, with a great passion for makeup?

_j1lQWHg8J0.txt,"Hey guys, it's Jessie v. So if you're wondering why I look a little bit higher up than I was before, it's because I have a new YouTube stool for filming. I used to have like a short chair that I've had the past five years of having YouTube channel, but today I upgraded I'll show you a lifted look. You can see it right there. This is my new chair. And it's a lot taller. So I'm just getting used to like being more like above the moon. You know what I mean? And it like spins and stuff. I am just I love this look. I'm like four years old, but not only did I get a new YouTube stool, I redid my whole entire YouTube studio. It's all redecorated. It's all like finished. It looks so good and I can't wait to show you guys I'm probably We're going to be doing a studio tour in the next week or two, because I've never shown what my studio looks like in this house. And I've just I've been hiding it from you guys. And it's going to be coming out of hiding really soon. So yeah, just be patient with that, but I'm just excited anyways, so just over a week ago, I did a video about philosophy phobia, which was a fear of just the unknown things in the ocean or in deep water. And you guys really seem to like this new phobia series that I made. So I thought why not make another one. I was looking through a lot of your comments on that video. And you guys have so many different fears. So there's so many that I can cover but today we are covering this fear and I hope that I can pronounce it correctly. You already saw it in the title. It's a bit complicated. Give me a second to try. And it's called Auto matondo phobia. Automatic phobia. otamatone a phobia. I think I got it. It's an even longer word than the last time if you could imagine that. Basically. It's a fear of human like figures and a lot of people have this fear. It could be wax figures. It could be humanoid robots. It could be animatronics mannequins, dolls, anything that looks human figured but is not alive. Now. I don't have a really serious fear of this. I would say if I am afraid of anything that's human looking statues really freaked me out statues and sometimes dolls. And while I was researching this, apparently most people like 90% of people in the world have a nervousness when they approach certain figures like this. It doesn't mean you have a full blown phobia, but maybe you'll unconsciously just get nervous when you approach them. It's like an uneasiness like have you ever been to a wax museum before? As cool as it is and I really enjoyed going to one there's something about approaching figures that are not alive that is just so uneasy, automaton a phobia can relate to a couple other fears one of those fears is called mask a phobia. So obviously the fear of people wearing a mask if you ever go to Disney World or Disneyland and if you were afraid of the characters walking around, you probably have mask a phobia. So this is more of an actual human being but they're covering their face with something. So automaton a phobia, which we're covering today is sort of like a more general phobia that covers all those things I mentioned statues, wax figures, robots, anything that's not alive, but looks human. You know what I mean? So we're gonna be looking through photos and if you are afraid of any of the things I'm about to show you, you probably have this fear. So get ready. This part always makes me so nervous. But we're gonna do it. Okay, I'm just gonna move over a bit. move my nice new stool. So this first one is a human like mannequin sitting on a couch. And I think the most unnerving part about this is that she looks So natural sitting there because usually you see mannequins looking like totally like up straight stiff everything but she's almost in a relaxed position which makes her look more real and it's freaking me out so much to look at. And what's even more strange is that when I found this picture, it's said that it was in someone's house. So this is not a mannequin in the store. Someone actually owns this mannequin and lives with it. So to each his own, but I mean, this next one is a little boy mannequin, and I don't know what freaks you guys out more when the mannequin is wearing like human clothing or when it's just clothing lists, and it's just kind of standing there staring at you which one's more freaky. I think it's more freaky when they're dressed up to look like this like a little boy, this next one, it makes me feel so weird when you walk into a store and they have like unique mannequins. You know what I mean? So like, for instance, this one is sticking out his tongue which by the way, looks too big for his mouth. I don't know what's going on here. And I guess the I fell out by accident but like, you know, when you walk into stores and like instead of like your standard mannequins, they have ones that are like, and like doing different things like no. Oh man, imagine walking through this clothing store trying to find a nice outfit and you head to this weird shirt section at the back and this guy is staring at you. His face is like, I can't handle it. I would actually scream in this store by saw this. This is what I mean about unique mannequins. You know what they kind of look like, you know, the who's from Whoville and the Grinch. That's what they look like. It looks like a camel just came over and licked their hair and now it's kind of like this you know what I made it I don't know what this make you want to walk into this store? Because Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So also ventriloquist dummies also fall into this category because like I said, it's a human like thing, but it's not alive. And oh, these dummies freak me out so much. And like, why is this person taking a picture of their newborn child with this thing looking into the crib and I hate Whoa, his hand is like kind of bear like it just looks so human. so creepy now. Oh, this next one. I don't know, guys. I mean, these are all like vintage photos of ventriloquist and back then this was like a really big deal. A lot of people were putting on shows with these dolls. People found it hilarious. People loved it. And I think over the years, it became more and more creepy because you don't really see this very often anymore. But yeah, these ventriloquists were very attached to their dolls. And that's why they took so many photos with them. And I don't know, I feel like they think they were their children or something. Oh, yeah. Like, why would you want this doll appearing over your shoulder like that? It doesn't make any sense to me. I can't. I don't know. And I mean, I'm not one to judge if this makes someone happy, then you know, do it good for you. But there's no way I would go to a photographer and be like, so can you take a picture of my creepy doll and I'll have it over my shoulder and he'll just be looking at me like this. Oh, man. Like I told you guys I am more afraid of statues than anything else. And this was taken a night vision I guess of someone walking through a graveyard. Imagine walking into this and don't get me wrong statues like this. They're so beautiful and an eerie way but I think approaching one at nighttime would just give me the heebie jeebies a little bit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why does the melt need to be open that wide? What was going through this person's head when he thought hey, I'm gonna make American look like this. Relax, close your mouth a bit. Relax. I think it's supposed to look really happy and like, you know, joyful, but I mean, take it down. Maybe 40% or 60% maybe it looks like I'm gonna walk through this store. And this thing's just gonna swallow me whole. You know? I don't get it. Oh, yeah, here we have another I think he's actually a doll maker. And he's taking a picture with all of his doll heads, you know, proudly displaying them and he's cool with it. He's totally fine with it, but I'm not so Of course we have the classic Chucky cheese so this is obviously an animatronic and this is sort of a more vintage picture so I probably saw this version of Chucky cheese when I was growing up because I was there in like the early 90s going to birthday parties and this this looks familiar for sure and it just looks like a depressed Chuckie cheese and it's probably good they changed the way he looks recently. Yeah, me and animatronics will never get along. So I guess this is a ventriloquist. That's what they call them, right? Because ventriloquist dolls so you must be the ventriloquist if you're the one controlling it right? Am I dumb? Anyways, this guy is putting on a show for little kids which you know, looking at it now it's freaky but I think back then they loved it. So I mean, what are we to do? It's weird how what freaks us out in this modern day and age didn't freak people out back then. It's weird how time changes your mindset. Oh, something about this. Like this. picture of this statue makes me so sad because I feel like I think she's crying over like a gravestone, which is heartbreaking. But at the same time, whenever a statue covers their face, I just get this feeling that I don't like, No, no, no, no, no, no, you're telling me, you're telling me they put happy faces on their mannequins? I think this whole store this whole clothing store, all of their mannequins have happy faces instead of like human faces. I just want to know who the creative designers are. For a lot of these mannequins. I genuinely want to know what their process was when they designed them. And I mean, cool, you know, hipster store. I'm trying to be different and have different mannequins cool. Maybe make them less scary. All right. Okay. Yep, this is another guy posing with his ventriloquist dummy. Why would they call dummies dummy? Is it because they're supposed to like be funny and dumb when they're on stage? And here is a family portrait. I think the is a husband and wife who both put on shows with these ventriloquist dolls. I don't know what like I said before when I see pictures of like stuff like this I feel like these two people have claimed these dolls and think they're their children. I get this bad. I feel like you could base a horror movie off of this, you know? Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah. Okay, this doll out of all of them looks the most human just because it's looking at the guy and he's like covering his mouth like, don't let them know you can talk now. Here's another one of those line mouth. mannequins in a random stores one's kind of like dirty and weird, but why? Why are stores taking this in? I just don't get it. Oh, man. This statute gives me the vibes like I just actually got chills looking at this. Like it's just so dark but intriguing. But also I wouldn't want to go that close to it. It's one of those things that you fear if you get too close, it'll suddenly move. You know what I mean? Oh, this one. Why is this look so oddly realistic. I think this was taken in a room filled with old broken mannequins. Have you ever walked into a room like that? Because I have before and it's the creepiest, especially when it's quiet and you're just staring at these broken dolls like all lined up in a row in a dark room. But yeah, anyways guys, those are all the photos we're gonna look at for automaton phobia. Did I say that right? I'm just gonna pretend I'm confident with the way I said and you guys will believe me But yeah, any of those photos gave you the creeps or actually made you really nervous you probably have this phobia let me know down below if you do it also comment other phobias that you want me to cover There are literally thousands of them this series could just be endless and a lot of you guys requested this phobia today, so let me know what you thought and Yeah, I definitely don't have this phobia like full blown but statues do freak me out. And mannequins do a little bit but definitely philosophy phobia was the worst so far. But who knows? I might find a fear while doing this series that freaks me out even more, but anyway. I hope you guys enjoyed this. I hope I didn't scare you too much. Remember the point of this series is not for me to like freak you out. I mean kind of, I guess but like not in a bad way. Sorry. Anyway, so I hope you have an awesome rest of your day and I will see you in my next video.

1l9-Tc1tYlo.txt,"compliments when you get one you feel amazing like an emotional little knuckle bump kind of like when you drop me one of those in if you want to make me feel good that would that that would help. Anyway for me the amount of compliments that I started to receive when I started wearing created Ventus was ridiculous and this was the first time I realized the power of a fragrance you smell amazing. It gives you an unfair competitive advantage. But on the flip side, if you smell bad, it also could interfere with you accomplishing and kicking life's ass. And so today in an attempt to help you smell even better, I'm going over 10 fragrance mistakes most men make first mistake that most men make is not actually wearing a fragrance. I have heard from so many dudes that are like no I don't I don't I don't wear a cologne. I don't wear fragrance. Gentlemen, here's the deal if you want to single handedly Take your sexiness from a six to a 12.75 give yourself a little juice before you leave the house wearing a fragrance that you love guys, it's like a spritz of confidence mixed with a dash of sexiness so few tips to find a signature scent. Alright I would not recommend you just going in blind to a department store a fragrance store that sells like a ton of fragrances or colognes and just start smelling instead what I would do is actually look for a recommendation do your research and then make a list of four or five fragrances that you're interested in trying and then go in and only smell those four or five fragrances or you could ask for a recommendation when you go in so you go to the sales associate and ask them say what's popular this year what's new, and have them help you identify and find a scent and I used to only wear created Ventus The problem with this fragrance is that it's super expensive. Recently I came out with my own fragrance at Pete and Pedro called rebel. It is modeled after created Ventus is not an identical copy, but it is definitely inspired. I wanted to make her fragrance that I loved that smelled similar to creed. That wasn't going to cost like 300 bucks This is under 50 and it is amazing guys if you want to check out rebel I'll link to it down below along with the discount code go and read the reviews. People are loving this fragrance another fragrance that I'm super excited about is this it is the final version of the newest addition to the Pete and Pedro fragrance family It is called hero it is not live yet but if you hit that link down below guys, you can go and sign up to be notified this stuff is ridiculous. It is light it is fresh, it is sexy guys, I will link to hero down below now it is not live yet but it will be very soon so depending on when you're watching it you may or may not be able to read the reviews but I'm assuming the reviews are going to be epic. Speaking of epic, are you making this epic mistake storing your fragrance out in the open in your bathroom for two reasons why keeping your fragrance on your counter in your bathroom is a horrible idea. The first reason is because it gets hot. Do you want to make sure that your fragrance stays at room temperature it's all about making sure that the fragrance and the oils in those fragrances don't get heated up and in the bathroom the shower hot. The other reason why you don't want to store your fragrance out in an area that gets a lot of sun is because the light also damages the fragrance keep it somewhere dark and keep it somewhere cool. What I recommend is in a closet in a drawer in a cabinet number three not applying your fragrance and for the shower post shower application is the best time to apply your signature scent and the reason is because after the shower, your pores are open, right and this is the ideal time in order to have that fragrance actually draw into your skin and actually hang out there and if you apply it to the appropriate pulse points. This is ensuring a better projection before using scented body lotions. So if you're looking to maximize the effectiveness of your fragrance guys, you don't want to apply it to dry skin which means you should apply a moisturizer but you got to make sure that the body lotion or moisturizer that you're using does not have a friend grunts you need to look for fragrance free or unscented and the reason it kind of makes sense, right? Because if you want to smell like unadulterated pure creed, or Polo or rebel or whatever your signature scent is, you don't want to layer it on top of mountain ocean for truly lavender. The fifth mistake that most guys make is in proper application. The missed gentlemen, at this point, you should know that the missed application technique is a no go in terms of proper application gentlemen, it boils down to the pulse points. Here's a great example of where your pulse points are on your body. All right, you're looking for the hot areas the areas in red are going to project your cologne better because of the blood flow. areas in yellow are good, not as good as red and green. Not so great blue band pulse boards are where the blood is like flowing in the more blood flow that an area has the more heated up it's going to get and the more that fragrance is going to be projected right. Something else I want you to do when you're applying. Don't hold the fragrance too far away. Three to six inches max. All right now for me what post points I go with I got one on this side of my neck, one on this and then one on and the wrist but the wrist is the post point that causes some issues and it's actually the sixth mistake guys like to rub in order to distribute. It's not a rub. It's a pat if you want to distribute from one to the past, the reason that rubbing is bad is because you don't want that fragrance to actually absorb into your skin right? You want it to sit on top. That's how you're going to get the best projection and when you rub you're helping it dive deep number seven no gentlemen never apply your signature center fragrance directly to your clothing and the reason so is the stuff in fragrances that make it smell amazing. Their oils and these oils can stain and so if you're like Yo I'm just going to kick it on my leather jacket your leather jacket, although amazing is going to get little drops of oily nastiness the eighth mistake that most men made is trying to take their regular size fragrance with them when they travel, they'll just toss it in their dopp kit. This is a horrible idea and there are a few reasons why it can leak and it can break and this is a lot of liquids. So if this spills in your bag, everything is going to stink, it's going to be too much it's going to be overpowering. I've also lost a pair of leather double monks, when a bottle of my cologne actually broke in my bag, it got on the shoes, it totally discolored them and I had to throw them out. Instead, a much better alternative is to get something like this little travel sprayer by Pete and Pedro. They sell them in different places, but the way that it works, all right, all you do, you pop off the top of your regular fragrance and then underneath there's this little like nozzle right? You just put it on there, you pump it up, it fills up the little reservoir in the travel sprayer and then pop this in your dopp kit, your grooming bag or your briefcase and then when you're ready, it's got a little sprayer bingo bang go it allows you to smell incredible on the go guys. If you want to check this out. I will link to it down below that mistake that most guys make Make what I call fragrant stagnation which means that you wear the same cologne for years but I get it right you get one compliment wearing a fragrance and it's like that's it game over this is what I want to wear for the rest of my life but the truth is that modern stylish gentlemen switch it up they have different options now even though I love rebel, I still have other fragrances in my arsenal I would recommend three fragrances and rotate them right maybe you've got one that you wear in the spring one that you wear in the winter maybe you just wear one at night guys fragrances are amazing. There's so many incredible ones out there. I would hate for you to get stuck on one like I do. I think of fragrances like food even though I love pizza. It's my favorite like I could eat pizza like every meal every day. I don't and the reason is because I don't want to get fat gentlemen don't get fragrance fat and last but certainly not least the 10th mistake that I've made at this point in the video is wearing too much break. I stink literally, I stink. I probably have like 27 squirts Rebel on an even though it smells amazing and it smells incredible on you. You shouldn't wear too much overpowering fragrances body washes or colognes are just as offensive as bad Bo or breath and I know I gotta go change clothes and shower bye bye

2QHV8ItNYT8.txt,"Hi, my name is Graham Steph and I'm 29 years old. I'm a real estate agent, investor and youtuber living in Los Angeles making 1.6 million per year. I have zero dollars in credit card debt, zero dollars in student loans 1.8 million in savings and just over $4 million in real estate investments. I spent $585,000 on this duplex and then I spent another $80,000 remodeling it. My mortgage is just over 20 $800 a month and my utilities are about $110 a month. I chose to buy and live in a duplex because I really wanted to save extra money and at least have some other rental income coming in to subsidize my cost of living. And this place took me about six months to find but when it came on the market, it was a really good deal and I knew I could rent out the other unit to basically pay for my mortgage and most of my property taxes and that way that would allow me to essentially live here completely rent or mortgage free. So growing up, my parents did not have any sort of abundance of money or anything like that and I definitely saw how hard they worked and a A lot of times it really was paycheck to paycheck. So I think seeing that really forced me to go and almost an extreme in terms of saving and investing and really making that a priority. So I would never have to worry about money. Even as a young kid I would always just be obsessed about saving everything I could get. And even from birthdays and Christmases have an envelope with just all my like $20 bills in there and I'd get really excited when I would hit like $100 I actually got more enjoyment, I think from saving than I did from spending so I became a millionaire by working as a real estate agent. Originally I planned to go to college, but when I didn't get into college, I was basically screwed. I had really bad grades in high school, and I figured I needed to do something and get some work experience per year before I reapply to colleges. I got my real estate license, I ended up really loving the career and then after I sold my first house, I was like I'm never going to college after this. So I've chosen to focus really on the luxury high end market here in Los Angeles. I would say my average price point is somewhere between two and $3 million. But the most expensive home I've sold is about 7 million. So my youtube channel is My name is Graham Steffen. And it's mostly about personal finance and investing and how to invest in real estate. My YouTube income varies month to month, but usually it's anywhere between 150,000 a month, and $250,000 a month. Welcome to my living room. For the most part, this is really decorative, I don't spend a lot of time in here, if I have any friends over, none of us are really hanging out in this room. It's mainly meant for just like looking aesthetically kind of nice. This over here is my couch that doesn't really get used that often. These are the pillows that actually came with the couch, I don't like them at all. Looks a little too patriotic red, white and blue. But you know what they're here again, we never really use it that much. So these two chairs I originally found on wayfair. But then what I did to save money is I did a reverse image search on Google and I found the exact same chairs from another company for half the cost. So in terms of furnishing my place, I was able to get the majority of it at wholesale cost so it really only cost me about 30% of what it would if I bought it at retail. The other thing I found is that you could shop online and usually find the Exact same item and product somewhere else for a lot cheaper. A lot of furniture is sold via drop shipping so that people markup the cost and they make a lot of profit from it. But if you just do a reverse image search on Google of the item you want to get almost always you could find it somewhere else for significantly cheaper and that's what I've done if I didn't get into wholesale this was actually given to me by a subscriber Russ, what's up man, your Lamborghini is right there that you ended up sending me they do end up getting sent some things from subscribers, they'll find out my work address and then send me things like a lot of letters or sometimes gift cards to Starbucks is a popular one. We're also subway and then of course, without further ado, you have probably my most prized possession. This is an autographed picture from Kenan and Kel. This is certainly one of a kind. I've had this for such a long time. This is another thing I found at some antique store. I think it's some sort of like replica ray gun somewhere. Going to comment down below and tell me what this is a replica from but my inner child came out when I saw this and I was like you got you got to get this this is just too cool not to buy so up here you have my three YouTube subscriber play buttons the gold one is for hitting a million and then the two silver ones are for hitting 100,000 then I have a candle here and a few people may have seen my video with Molly who also did a money tour is here on the channel and glamour over here. We have our mahogany teakwood candle it's my favorite. We probably go through one a week it's kind of bad. She was spending way too much. She's spending like $30 a week on candles but I was telling her you can get candles for a few dollars each at Ross You have no idea how expensive they are. And I think this was like three bucks but it looks like it could be a 15 or $20 candle. It's a great way to save a lot of money. This is something I actually did myself with a friend a contractor wanted like $600 to go and redo this because Spanish Tile is believe it or not really expensive but I found a place that shipped directly from Mexico and this was $2 a tile so I got it shipped to the whole thing. For really under about $160 This is my dining room and the dining room table is something that I never actually used for eating I mostly just use it for editing videos really late at night for some reason. This is my favorite spot just to sit there and edit the chairs is something that I absolutely hate them I was looking through a catalogue when picking out the furniture and I thought these were meant to match this set. It doesn't match these look like grandma chairs but I hope that nobody notices so I just push them in and just leave it. These are things that I bought from Ross I like fish but I didn't buy it specifically for the fish I thought it was just too good of a price not to get so over here you have my bar and this is something I never really used this is just visually looks kind of cool and fills a space I almost never drink this is Diet Coke mixed with water. It's not actually Jim Beam honey. Same with this you would have no idea that this is not jack daniels instead it's just Diet Coke and water and you find the right mixture and it looks exactly like jack daniels. All of this is really just for decoration and I want to make it seem like I have a fully stocked bar when actually reality and the stock bar full of water Down Diet Coke and, and water. And by the way proof It's just water. So this is my kitchen I remodeled it about two and a half years ago There used to be a big wall up here that I decided to take down open up so now brings in a lot more natural light. I got the quartz countertops here which are horrible to keep clean, I thought it would be a really good idea to have white countertops and then I realized that anything you put on them is going to leave a bit of a mark so I spend way too much time trying to keep these clean. So a lot that I have in my kitchen isn't really that functional, but I think it looks kind of cool. Like a lot of this I've made to look really just aesthetically pleasing with things that I've kind of got for free like this seller was moving out in our throwing it away. So I'm going to put it in my kitchen and same with some of these other things in here. Admittedly, I don't really have that much any Hear because they don't really cook that often. So I have a basic set of plates that I got off Amazon. I prefer actually to use some of the paper plates so I don't have to do any dishes and then I keep these sitting here just because they look kind of good and it makes it look like I have some stuff in the cupboards. And then of course we always got to rep the march This is one of the slogans and you can find it exclusively at Graham Stephens. store.com so I got some other stuff over here that kind of fills the space a little bit some olive oil marinara sauce is pasta and then this is something actually found at Ross I saw this on sale for like five bucks that you know it would kind of go here it looks pretty beachy and fits nicely in this space. And then most importantly I have my Mr. Coffee coffeemaker not sponsored of course but I do really like Mr. Coffee. So this whole coffee thing really became another little bit on my channel because they never go out and buy coffee because I could just make it at home for 20 cents and that's just what I've always done just to save the extra money. So underneath you have my trashcan here and one of the cool things I do to save money Is I reuse the old grocery bags and actually save a lot of money on doing this I don't buy garbage bags. Just put this over and look. It's pretty much the same thing and you don't need to buy any garbage bags. So don't really do that much cooking but I will make breakfast every single morning I religiously eat the exact same thing it's to eggs cheese ham, and then sometimes if I'm feeling really adventurous, I'll have half a bagel with coffee Of course I spent about $200 a month on groceries and another $150 a month eating out. I also like to look for happy hours if you're going to go out to eat you may as well just go and find that two hour window where things are going to be half price and just eat as much as you can then and that's going to usually save you about like 30 to 50% in your food bill Tapi our sushi or all you can eat sushi is the one thing that I just I love it anytime I can go and eat sushi or find all you can eat sushi. I will find a excuse to do it. Normally this is about 1200 dollars but I waited for a Labor Day Sale and got both of these For 800 Welcome to my bedroom the bed frame I got years ago from IKEA the mattress was given to me for free by Casper. I represented them as a company many years ago as a real estate agent and they gave me a free mattress when I found them a house which is pretty cool. This is my Nicolas Cage pillow case a subscriber sent this to me I joked about it in one of my videos and now I own one I never thought I would say this, but I sleep on Nicolas Cage every single night and I will see you in your dreams. So this is the only TV in my house. I really don't watch that much TV so I don't have one in the living room. But every now and then if I want to watch Netflix YouTube, you could turn this on here I again, I really don't watch that much TV. Then over here I have my YouTube subscriber play button. This was given to me as a gift during one of the speaking engagements I went to. So I set it up I hooked it up here and it keeps track of my second channel. So this is where all the magic happens. And I film all my videos. It's a 400 square foot garage that I remodeled to turn into my studio, I had it drywalled added electricity recessed lighting and I added some sound deadening materials just so that it's not as echoey in here, this table I got from Urban 95. I really liked these Restoration Hardware desks with the aviation style, but they were all like three to $5,000 but I found that Urban 95 had the exact same desk for under 1000 bucks. I bought two books, these are totally random eBay books that I bought for $1 each that makes it look like I'm a lot smarter, and I really am. And then this dinosaur skull here, this is a replica from wayfair and I got it I thought it looked really cool. I spend way too much time making a video I would say every video that I make usually takes about eight to 10 hours to produce and some of that is researching the topic actually planning out the video, filming the video and then editing it and trying to piece together a good title and thumbnail. So as far as my equipment I keep it very simple. I have a Canon 70 D with a sigma 1.8 lens that I use to film most of my videos and then I have a Canon add with just a wide angle kit lens or any wide angle shots I need or if I'm filming out somewhere I tend to use that camera. For audio, I just use a comical wireless mic, they ended up giving me that for free to test it out and just review it and it's free. And I really like it. As far as lighting is concerned, I have an LED ring lights that I use as my main source of lights. And then I have two LED panels that I use for more like soft lights as well. It might look a little weird to see the towels on my lights. But what I found is that these towels work really well for light diffusions that way it's not too harsh on the background. These towels were perfectly for that. So I taught myself everything when it comes to editing, I had no idea what I was doing. So I went on YouTube, and I searched like how to edit on iMovie. And even to this day, I'm using iMovie the free software on my Mac and that's it. And I figured I would use iMovie just because it was free. Why spend extra money if I didn't have to and it was already there. So why not? I would say my favorite thing about this place is that it really doesn't cost me anything to live here and that gives me a lot of Financial Peace of mind just knowing that, you know, worst case scenario if just everything's fine entirely that I will be totally fine here but they don't have to stress about it. flammer Thanks so much for stopping by and for you watching. If you've not already smashed the like button Make sure to absolutely destroy it for the YouTube algorithm.
